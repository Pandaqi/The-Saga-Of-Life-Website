## 1. Shadowshifters
Jaco asks Gidi to get items from his bag. She keeps grabbing the wrong ones.

They find a small patch of green and gather food, while Jaco eats two dead squirrels (killed by Shadowshifters). Gidi is startled again, but reminds herself that Jaco should be a scavenger.

He tells her about the Florian religion: about Ra and his children, their quarrel, and how there are now four pyramids where those children are buried. One in each corner of Floria. They are now heading to the last one they're still missing: the Pearl Pyramid.

He also says he is in exile, so this whole new continent (Floria) is the only place he can be. Doesn't want to say why.

And then they hear Shadowshifters very close by.

## 2. The Sphinx
They have to answer questions to get past the Sphinx.

We discover what some of the days are named after. (The time periods before this didn't have named days in Somnia.)


* Wednesday after Wo (High Cloud)
* Sunday after Ra (Sun God)
* Thursday after Donte (Dinosaur)

Jaco can't do math, Gidi can.

Four Shadowshifters reach them. Jaco keeps them at bay while Gidi tries to figure out the last question.

## 3. Hidden traps
Behind the sphinx is desert again, but after walking a bit they reach the sea and see the Pearl Pyramid: it catches moonlight/sunlight and spreads it over the many pearls like a disco ball.

("No one walks around a sphinx": the surrounding sand is designed to pull you back and send you the wrong way.)

Those pearls formed naturally, where heat, sand and sea converge.

Jaco pounds the ground to test its sturdiness. A large section collapses, leaving only a bridge.

The pyramid has no entrance. But Jaco hears wind blowing somewhere. It's an optical illusion: cloths painted like stone, they walk through those.

They need to get to the Hall of Truth, where Anubis---Osiris's child, god of death---weighs your soul. Jaco and Gidi don't know whether to believe it's real.

Then Jaco yells for Gidi to watch out.

## 4. The Hall of Truth
They reach the Scale. They have no choice but to weigh their souls.

Gidi is feather-light and may proceed immediately. The scale has great difficulty with Jaco.

By cheating somewhat and throwing heavy objects on the other side, he just barely passes. (This suggests, by the way, that the legend isn't true and it's not a magical scale that purely measures your soul.)

Thinking they're safe, Gidi asks why he's even protecting her. He says she's too important.

Before he can explain, the Shadowshifters storm in and destroy the scale.

Gidi can no longer flee because of the wound on her leg. Jaco decides to stay as well and try something else.

## 5. Horus's Riddle
Jaco convinces the Shadowshifters (sort of) that there is a second part to the legend and that they need their help to find it. And if they don't, and just leave the pyramid, they'll be cursed forever.

Halek (the leader) thinks Jaco is secretly looking for treasure, a secret weapon, because that's how he knows him. He spares their lives and says they have to lead the way.

The other desert foxes all seem to be "every man for himself" and take offense at the idea of Halek as leader.

Jaco is suspected of the robbery at the bank in _Heldehaven_. Says he didn't do it, but was exiled for a kidnapping.

They split up. Jaco and Gidi choose the passage that, according to Gidi, is the right one. Jaco saves everyone from the next trap: stones that trigger a mechanism if you step on them.

But the wild Shadowshifters in the other passages trigger traps, thereby blocking off those passages.

Halek furiously confronts Jaco. Jaco remains calm and says a riddle is on the wall.

## 6. The math whiz
They realize "ra ra" is derived from the fact that the riddle is addressed _to Ra_. So it's from a child. A child who hid a lot.

Eventually they figure Horus is the best candidate and search the _ceiling_, where after some time they find a hidden falcon. Jaco hits that stone and the whole group falls down.

Once in a safe room, the Shadowshifters have had enough. They depose Halek (their "leader"), tie him up along with Jaco + Gidi, and continue on their own.

(Gidi is certain this was the right passage. Because according to the gods, fractions could only be perfect: with a "1" in the denominator. This was the only fraction that couldn't be reduced to that form.)

Halek remains angry and hostile for a bit, but quickly realizes the situation he's in. Says they were just trying to survive too.

Jaco asks him to grab an amulet. With that he cuts himself loose, then the rest (with his dagger).

The door is barricaded. But Jaco sees a way to do something fun with that.

## 7. Breathlessness
Jaco gets the idea to pretend to be Anubis and chase the desert foxes. (He uses a statue with an opening on top as a megaphone, while Gidi + Halek make noise and smoke.)

The Shadowshifters come back to the room. There Jaco trips them up.

But Halek was prepared and immediately ties them up with a rope. They leave them behind in the room and walk on.

A maze. Gas is slowly released, forcing them to hurry. They use a safe strategy/trick from Jaco: hand against left wall and keep following it.

After walking a long time they come to an open area. A pool of water, orb in the middle that makes it look like the space is full of mirrors, with green stones around it.

Everyone is starving, everyone can barely breathe anymore.

Halek wants to sit down---Jaco stops him.

## 8. The unexpected pearl monster
The stones are (probably) covered in Gripping Glass. Gidi falls asleep and doesn't wake up anymore.

Jaco and Halek look for clues but find nothing. Then he asks why on earth Jaco wants to save the royal family ( = Gidi).

Jaco explains what really happened: the power of the dune gazelles was _good_. But their grandfather went mad, probably enchanted, and destroyed everything they had built up. Jaco couldn't stand to watch. He put the whole family to sleep and took Gidi with him, in whom he saw the most potential.

Halek is surprised. That explains why they were able to so easily ... (Heavily implied they, shortly after Jaco put the family to sleep, murdered the royal family.)

Jaco expects the Companions and their soldiers to come for him any moment. So he wants to find the treasure to bribe them. Halek explains this is _exactly_ what kept the Shadowshifters going: people already thought they were bad, so there was no use trying to be good.

He sacrifices himself to find the solution. When he hears it's called the _Pearl Pyramid_, he dives into the water and examines the pearls. In so doing, however, he does touch the Gripping Glass.

As a green monster he can just barely surface and report: the pearls form the symbol of a staff.

And then he lets go and drowns.

Jaco and Gidi press the symbol of a staff, a door opens, they walk on. But this space seems recently visited, much better maintained, and halfway down the stairs they suddenly hear sound.

## 9. Osiris and the King
The room is full of treasures, and a skeleton of a tusked animal (Ardex), but most prominently a Lion King (and a Companion) is locked up.

He doesn't allow Jaco to steal treasures. But Jaco trusts him less and less: he's been missing for years, yet fit, healthy, etc.

Then Isis returns. The lion is genuinely scared. Jaco and Gidi hide.

Isis reveals he is Anniwe (of Turtle Town, the companion who threatened the Wise Owl). That he himself murdered the demigods, or bribed others to do it.

That's what the four pyramids are for. Solomon changed his name to Nephthys. The falcon Horus was one. Osiris and Set remain, but unknown.

But when he asks why Isis built this pyramid, she refuses to answer. She locks up the lion again.

Jaco and Gidi decide to leave.

Jaco reveals he did rob Heldehaven after all, doesn't want Gidi to portray him so positively. But she doesn't want to be queen, reminds him of all the good he's done, and asks him to be king.

They flee up a spiral staircase. The other Shadowshifters have gotten free and are chasing them.

They push a pearl out of the roof, climb on top, slide down, and the Pearl Pyramid definitely collapses.

The Shadowshifters are extinct. The fate of Isis and the imprisoned lion is uncertain.

They decide to become king and queen together.

## 10. Epilogue
Jaco is grounded. He did secretly steal something from Isis's treasure after all.

Besides, Gidi is afraid there is a curse on it. Strange things are happening. Like the Pearl Pyramid suddenly reappearing out of nowhere.

Gidi sends a letter saying she found a new seed: greenglass, which Jaco simplifies to grass.

Jaco says people are unhappy about their king(queen). But he ridicules the tigers' idea of rule of the strongest, fighting until someone wins.

Jaco examined the second part of the legend but doesn't understand it at all. A drawing of two pandas, one white, one black, with something resembling a wooden clock in the background.

Sends the squirrel away with the parchment, maybe the Wise Owl can make something of it.

By now they have boats, although not too many, and this is still a rather new invention.
