## 1. Prologue
Eeris announces new rules: if you are mean, the gods will intervene and punish. These _Dracs_ are quite strict and intense (almost everything leads to death by fire), which causes a shock reaction in the animals.

Dilova is a Protobird missing one foot. Her father is more dinosaur-like, tells about his belief: that there is a Supreme God, that the Ghostbird in the sky is his guardian/messenger, that _he_ threw the asteroid at the dinosaurs.

Dilova wants nothing more than to float above everything forever too, especially since her one little foot always gets so heavily burdened.

She practices flying, over and over, until one time it goes a bit better: the Ghostbird helped her by accident. And then she sees that the Ancient Turtles have done something bad: they've come ashore.

## 2. The great stairs
A few weeks later, Cosmo flies into some stairs that are getting quite high. The animals are busy building, don't want to say anything.

At the bottom he meets Fiante (Dilova's father), who says it's for her, because she wants to see the Ghostbird up close.

Cosmo finds it very strange. Warns them there is nothing _there_ above, they'll die. They think he's lying (to "protect the supreme god") and happily continue.

Cosmo hears about "the egg thief" who has been stealing their eggs for a while now.

He goes to Eeris and they discuss why this is such a big problem and what they should do about it.

## 3. The guilty shell
Eeris goes back to investigate the stairs. Hears again about the egg thief. Dilova speaks to her, looking for a place with air currents to see if that helps her fly.

Eeris says Cosmo's throne, the Gigageysers, are perfect. Dilova lets slip that Eeris should maybe check out the Ancient Turtles.

She does. By now they've walked a bit further. They work together with other beasts (mostly snakes), but communication is difficult. The turtles have their very own language and are the only ones who actually understand all the gods' symbols.

But the plan becomes clear: the stairs are full of materials (wood/stone) that they want to take, so they're moving in that direction.

Eeris realizes that's why the stairs are being built: they're afraid the gods will heavily punish everyone again for the Ancient Turtles' actions.

She doesn't know what to do. Telling could have terrible consequences, but letting it happen unchecked also has terrible consequences. She stays quiet.

## 4. The Gigageysers
The stairs are now high enough that they pass the Throne of Tomorrow. (Which is meanwhile no longer reachable any other way, since everyone is angry at the gods they closed it off.)

Dilova takes the river to the geysers. Much faster. She nearly drowns, but the Ghostbird accidentally saves her again.

Yes, the geysers help! But they are unpredictable, chaotic, and toss her to the ground just as easily.

She sees white eggs. Thinks these are Cosmo's children, maybe Ghostbirds will hatch from them.

But when Cosmo returns, she flees, and realizes _he is the egg thief_.

## 5. The coincidental disasters
Cosmo, Eeris and Darus try to secretly thwart the stair builders. With Eeris as distraction, they steal their supplies.

But the next day Fiante acts as if it was a "test" and through sheer willpower they find new methods.

So the next evening they plan to steal the tools. (Which only the Gosti have and use.)

Eeris comes by the Ancient Turtles again, who are now _much_ closer. She decides enough is enough. She confronts Abrahon, but he is arrogant and doesn't care at all. That makes her angry: she conjures a small forest around him, trapping him for at least a day or two.

When she reaches the camp, Cosmo and Darus have already found another way. Darus made tiny cracks in the tools. So when they try to work the next day, their hammers suddenly shatter.

But again Fiante sees it as a test and they figure out a way to keep building. The gods become hopeless.

## 6. The egg mission
The next day many creatures are sick or very sleepy. (Quite clear that this was the gods again, through the food/drink.)

Fiante seems to briefly doubt, get frustrated, lose faith. But thanks to Dilova he finds strength again. It's still a test and they will continue!

Dilova goes on a mission (with two Equids and Gosti) to steal the eggs back from Cosmo. Not only that, they want to catch him red-handed and asked Eeris to come.

When they get there, Cosmo comes home, with his ghostbird. They try to hide and wait, but give themselves away. When Cosmo finds them, they accuse him of stealing eggs, upon which he immediately becomes angry and banishes them all from this continent.

Just in time Eeris appears to stop him.

## 7. The last bird
Eeris figures Cosmo out, the Ghostbird is old and dying. He says he stole a dino egg and gave it wings with magic, that's where the Ghostbirds come from. He tried the same with the rest of the eggs.

But he now knows that all life made from magic isn't real life. The Ghostbirds have no hunger, no enemies, no feelings, want nothing, can't reproduce.

He lets the bird go and reconciles with Eeris. She wants them all to be honest with each other again (within the god family).

So she tells about the Ancient Turtles, the reason for the stairs. Cosmo is getting Bella involved to make a decision, Eeris returns hoping to speak honestly with the creatures one more time.

That goes wrong when the creatures decide to work through the night and immediately finish the stairs.

## 8. The invisible Supreme God
They continue building the stairs. Fiante says everything necessary to motivate the others, even as animals fall off (to their deaths), even as the clouds completely work against them.

Dilova no longer supports him. She tries to talk him out of it, but can't get through. More animals fall. Dilova barely rescues them, getting an idea from it.

The Gosti abandon him. The rest continue.

But Fainte leaves them behind so he can be the first to grab the highest step. At first nothing seems to happen. The other creatures follow.

Then Fainte falls down screaming. (The others don't even see it, obsessed with where the stairs end.) Dilova tries a dive flight. Cosmo comes back at lightning speed.

## 9. High birds can fall far
Dilova can finally fly by diving! Grabs her father, but he's too heavy. She puts him down on the stairs, but her father has changed. Doesn't respond to anything, looks right past her, she has to _push_ him down.

Cosmo destroys the stairs with flaps of his wings. Eeris rescues who she can, Bella arrives and helps too.

Some still fall, others make it safely to the ground. Everyone seeks shelter from the falling debris.

The stairs are virtually completely destroyed and everyone saved who could be. Dilova now knows she can fly by diving and knows she can do it, even without the high stairs.

The Ancient Turtles have finally arrived. They immediately take the debris. Bella says they have to disappear, stay in the water, and she'll punish them (through Ardex the fire god) if they ever come out again.

Dilova's father's mind is broken.

## 10. Epilogue
Dilova is the first of the _doves_ (= diving birds). Teaches it to others, doesn't always work. Can now also do it from lower heights.

The gods speak in Atheeni. They're angry at each other, but find common ground in the plan to keep fighting for life on their world, and that they're still family. (Wish Hanah was here.)

They establish the _clansteads_. The groups and territories that have slowly taken shape are allowed their own name, leader, rules. And the gods merely try to keep the groups out of each other's hair.

Birds are allowed to fly anywhere (instead of staying within their territory). The Gosti get off well (because they fled), other animal species suffered great losses during the disaster. The gods reopen their gate (Throne).

The rest of the animals come a day later: they celebrate the arrival of autumn, as they always celebrate new seasons together in Atheeni.

Except the Ancient Turtles of course. Dilova sees snakes seeking them out. They're sticking to the agreement ... but speak of another plan to remove the gods.
