## 1. The star in the darkness
Next rocket launches. Prins and Pika (two whistling hares) search in the darkness for rare sunbeams where there is still food/drink.

Prins keeps pulling them further north. Pika hates the humans and no longer believes in them. They walk through what once was the Dolphin Pass ( = Gulvi's throne), but now it is barren, without water, and Gulvi has certainly left.

The air is black. Permanently warm and stuffy. Long periods the same, then weeks of rain showers and severe storms.

They finally find a spot. But just as they stand there, the rocket explodes over their heads. They have to flee and the green spot gets scorched.

## 2. The new plan
They have to search further. Pika's aversion to humans grows further. Prins especially wants to stay with her.

They find a koala at the top of a small tree. Akoa explains that the leaves she still has are now poisonous too.

She found a pass for the rocket base and wants to go with them ( = be carried) to flee together from this wasteland via a rocket.

With difficulty they still convince Pika to make that the new plan.

## 3. The slippery mission
They come to the slope that gets them out of the Dolphin Pass and onto the land. They bend the tree and slingshot Akoa upward. They themselves hop. A penguin tackles them by accident. The rocket is already almost launching.

Pika tries to find another way, without humans, hopes Pinpin will take them. But he confirms the Northern Ice Sheets are gone and his family was scattered by humans.

Together they run through the gate (with the pass), up the stairs, to the high platform---but they arrive just too late.

## 4. Kran's weapons
The foursome slides through gas/ventilation pipes down the tower, until they come out on the ground floor. A brightly lit room, otherwise deserted.

Prins is angry at Pika. Because of her dragging her feet they missed it. They walk further across the terrain, to a building where they might see when the next rocket departs.

Prins recognizes the dots that the radar indicates, but doesn't know exactly what from.

Pika is completely done with it and wants to get away from humans for good. Prins specifically wants to beg humans for food and help. They form two groups.

A young human woman comes in and gets scared. Pika and Pinpin immediately flee outside. Prins and Akoa stay behind. The woman tries to chase them away with a broom, but it's no use.

Prins realizes the radar indicates Kran's weapons. They point to it until Mindy also understands: she informs her superior.

## 5. The wind watcher
Pika and Pinpin walk further, through a scorched forest, along a stone path that leads to a cottage.

Pinpin talks about the past. That even before humans there was unnecessary fighting and destruction. About how they descend from Owls that fled and came to the ice sheets, how the Wise Owl still prevented many conflicts.

The rocket that departed earlier exploded too. The debris destroyed a protrusion on the roof of the cottage (and the surroundings). They roll into the front yard. Although this grass also looks ill, Pika eats from it and enjoys it. (Pinpin needs fish as food.)

Until a large bird comes from above and attacks. They dodge the beast, long enough until it destroys more parts of the roof and the person inside the house shoots the bird down.

The man in the house hears warnings about Kran, and is responsible for giving the weather report (as "Wind Watcher"). But all his devices say nothing is wrong, so he stays and passes on that positive message.

They walk on and leave the man as he is.

## 6. The highest minister
Mindy and animals sit with highest minister (Goettot) and military advisor.

The minister wants to immediately fire back Kran's own weapons. That's the rule: they are so destructive that no one uses them, because then the rest will react.

The advisor says they are now beyond the rules and urges something better.

Mindy says the animals are intelligent and warned her of the danger. Goettot has already arranged things, signed papers, and opens the secret wall to the big red button. Prins hears a scraping sound and grabs a pen to put something on paper.

Mindy and the Advisor decipher it enough to delay Goettot. They urge a full evacuation mission, where all people immediately go into rockets into space. (Accelerating a plan they already had anyway.)

Goettot doesn't listen, the advisor is dragged away. But the delay is enough for the Sand King to put everyone to sleep and prevent the button from being pressed.

He explains that he follows the koala a lot, because she sleeps so much, and that the whole day/night rhythm ( = sleep rhythm) is messed up since the air is always black, and that everyone is therefore depressive, and he wants it to stop.

He urges the advisor to still do the evacuation plan.

## 7. The last whistling hare
Pika and Pinpin can't take it anymore. Food is gone, hope is gone, around them rockets launch one after the other at breakneck speed and pollute everything even more.

She regrets it. She wants to be with Prins, but knows this is the end here. Realizes now that the grass she ate was poisonous.

Pinpin tells how he did the same thing. When humans came to do research and live in their habitat, he refused to accept their care (food/shelter/etc).

And now he was alone, without care, while his family probably was doing great.

Pika realizes she shouldn't stubbornly hold on and might as well make one last attempt, human or not. They gather their energy and walk back to the cottage, against the wind, nearly blown away.

Pika makes one final attempt and whistles as many alarm signals as she can. When the storm calms down a bit, they run to the window and bang on it.

Aliber gives a little food, but nothing else. Because of the stormy wind the entire window swings open and Pinpin/Pika fall inside.

All the other whistling hares storm in. Together they eat and drink their fill, and gesture to Aliber what's going on. He finally realizes his equipment is broken, looks out the window, and sees the real situation.

## 8. The cage choice
Prins happily walks into the cage himself, with complete trust in the humans.

Mindy is actually supposed to stay behind to push the last button and make sure everyone definitely gets away safely---but she has doubts. She also reveals that the researchers are coming soon to take them along.

While she runs around arranging everything and firing rockets, Prins tries to make it clear to her that she herself must get in a rocket.

She listens. She grabs the cage and walks onto the terrain, but an older man stops her. He discovers Mindy doesn't have a ticket/pass for the rocket. He is willing to trade his own, including gold coins, for that cage with animals.

It's a difficult choice for Mindy whether she wants to live in that "cage" (rocket) for tens of years. Or whether she stays behind and does something important. But the man says she already lives in a cage now.

He convinces her. She gives away the animals and takes the ticket.

## 9. The two worlds
Mindy realizes how strange it is that the man gave away his own ticket. That he paid in gold coins. (One rocket is full of arguing people about faith and such, she walks to the other.)

She runs back. She finds the man a little further at a brightly lit helicopter, where he's loading all kinds of stuff.

She throws back the ticket/money sack. Demands the animals. He grabs a gun and refuses.

An all-terrain vehicle screeches around the corner and crashes into the helicopter. In the distraction she grabs the cage and jumps in.

Aliber took all the animals along. They both discover having no access pass. They race onto the rocket base, hide the animals under their coats, and walk to the entrance.

The boy there is another intern, a (sort of) friend of Mindy's. He is suspicious. When Mindy starts begging, Akoa holds up two passes she had gathered in her pouch by now.

They can go inside. But according to protocol there's only room for one human. Mindy immediately runs to the other rocket and slides in, thanks to the sliding Pinpin, just in time.

When launching, Prins looks out the window. Pika stands behind the window on the other side.

## 10. Epilogue
Kran's weapons do ... nothing on impact. Later they discover it was a bluff. The group wanted the black air to be broken through and a large part of the world to leave. Either Aprania would flee, or they would send back weapons and destroy themselves, they would win either way. The man who once offered Mindy a ticket was one of their leaders. (Their previous world now seems to be healing, but they can easily turn the rocket around, so they don't go back.)

The animals cause some chaos in the rockets, but eventually everyone arrives safely on a planet. They make it habitable, as clean as possible, and Mindy is half revered and half scorned.

She doesn't care. She works on her own spacecraft for a long time, does research on animals (and learns to communicate with Prins).

Until the message comes in from a nearby planet where humans had also landed: Pika's rocket will have gone to the Nibuwa system.

Not much later, when Prins and Akoa are already getting old and only have a couple years left, she departs with them on the way there. This time in the best cage they could choose themselves.
