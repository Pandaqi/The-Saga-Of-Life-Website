## 1. The pillars of Gibra
Teacher ends the lesson, as always, with: "if you work hard, you'll grow old alone!"

Slupper daydreams. Says he doesn't want to grow old alone.

Teacher says it will happen anyway. Explains that there is only one turtle still in contact with other creatures: their Companion who helped establish peace and end the First Conflict.

Slupper gets from her where that one must be: the Pillars of Gibra. Goes on an adventure right away with his friend (Socipi) to the north of the city.

(Many strange things. A fountain underwater, a forest underwater, doors in classrooms that could never open or aren't needed.)

They meet a hyperactive fish (Vivienne) who uses them as a train, and they ask her the location of the Pillars.

She can't tell: she has to show it.

## 2. Solomon the Old
Vivienne leads them along the _many_ hills to Solomon's cave. Tells that earlier today a masked figure also asked the way to Gibra.

Slupper and Socipi now think the Companion is in danger. They race there.

Vivienne asks their names, wants to slow down, wants to stop them. They react annoyed and ignore it. Slupper only gets a leaflet pressed into his fin.

At the cave they hear Solomon talking with someone about a secret mission and everyone should stay away from them.

Then they're discovered. Solomon is a giant turtle, much bigger than the shark with him.

Is hostile at first, thinks they're spies. But then he checks out the friends' shells and decides to trust them. Even more, he wants to be their mentor and collaborate on the mission.

(Reference to Gulvi somewhere swimming in the water and can heal creatures with one touch.)

Tells them they will learn a lot. Like that this city isn't what they think it is.

## 3. The discovered city
Solomon explains he was the only one of his family to hatch (on the beach) and make it to the sea. But they immediately had to flee from _something_. Until they found this city, as if it had just been abandoned.

Using maps and clay tablets he deduces the city must have stood _above water_, and an earthquake + volcanic eruption dragged it to the seafloor.

(The maps are only partially finished and just slightly different from how they know the city. Clay tablets are dumb underwater and only contain mundane things like how many soldiers they have in their army.)

Socipi and Slupper get the task of searching everywhere for texts/artifacts from the original inhabitants, for clues.

Why does it have to stay secret? The city keeps drifting further from shore. In a few years new turtles won't be able to find it anymore. But he doesn't want to cause panic and wants to solve it before anyone suffers from it.

## 4. The broken promise
When they return, half the city has gone searching for them. When they get back to Socipi's house, Slupper suddenly recognizes drawings at the bottom of the stairs.

Socipi reveals everything about Solomon. The parents/teacher especially get angry and don't really listen to the contents.

Slupper's parents want him to find new friends and obediently do homework. Socipi's parents are chill. The teacher rattles on about punishments and how they'll only go to high school when they're thirty-five and can only walk certain streets.

The next day they pretend to listen, but race to Solomon anyway.

He gets mad and sends Socipi away for good. He's completely done with it and tells Slupper he should find new friends too.

## 5. Years of true lessons
We skip forward in time: Slupper grows up.

He's worked together with Solomon for all those years. Collected 99 drawings, but translated with ancient pigeon it makes no sense. The city is almost _too_ far from shore now.

One last plan: a legend of a grand people who wrote a book called "The Truth". But unclear whether it was meant for _world peace_ or _world domination_. Could have been the original inhabitants.

For that they go searching in the dangerous Outer Rings. Slupper says goodbye to his mother, who still doesn't know he collaborates with Solomon.

Together they dive into the ravine (the entrance to the Outer Rings)

## 6. A false memory
The Outer Ring was used to transport food/supplies by Alasti (the earlier people who lived here, as Solomon knows). But there was also a lot of fighting and there were often intruders.

The traps there keep sea monsters out of the turtle city.

Vivienne joins. She lives there after all. She warns Slupper again, who doesn't want to listen.

She deliberately leads them to a dangerous area. A sea monster comes at them.

They use the trap---an automatic arrow and bow---to eventually shoot it down.

But when they return triumphantly to the hill, Solomon has disappeared.

## 7. The stream of truth
Vivienne is done with Slupper. Says he has to completely trust her, or she'll leave him behind here and never wants to see him again.

He realizes how much he cares for her, and that he's being stupid. So he trusts her _if_ she has a good explanation for why Solomon is so bad.

She tells that long ago Solomon disturbed and destroyed her home, so he could steal information from them, and murdered her parents.

She leads them to the cave she knows has the symbol of a book. It has the same symbols and weird lamps as Solomon.

But she can't go further: the rooms behind here have no water, are airtight.

Slupper doesn't want to leave her behind. He breaks down the wall with his shell and fills the rooms with water.

After a few steps it suddenly becomes very dark.

## 8. The hard truth
It's Solomon, quite angry that Slupper let water into the rooms, because now the book will be ruined.

Solomon admits to having lied. He did experience when the island stood above water, when the Primal Turtles existed (what they descend from), his great grandfather helped build it. The houses were for the children of Primal Turtles. They could after all _walk_ through the city, something they unlearned when turtles only lived in the sea.

They search and search, but find nothing. The water rises above the notches in the walls, causing the lamps to go out, and the current picks up speed.

And that's how Solomon remembers it again: the original inhabitants discovered _Electro_, a way to make things happen automatically from a distance.

Together they generate current by sending the water through a wheel and open the secret wall that way.

There's the book. Slupper doesn't trust Solomon anymore, lays a fin on the book and wants to read it himself. But Solomon pushes them away, arguing he has the best memory and the book will be lost soon anyway.

He reads, he looks surprised: the book is completely blank.

## 9. World friend
Solomon thinks Slupper switched out the book.

Slupper makes up a story about why the Primal Turtles would have done this on purpose.

Solomon doesn't buy the excuse. Thinks they're unnecessarily against him and reminds them the danger (of drifting away) still looms.

Until Socipi suddenly returns. He tries to convince Slupper to capture Solomon. He simply wanted Primal Turtles to return and reconquer the world, that was his plan all along.

Slupper finally turns around, helps capture Solomon, and they swim back. He tells his parents the truth.

They examine the hundredth drawing, the one Slupper had missed all along and not looked at again, in Socipi's house.

With some difficulty they realize it says "this city is no city". Solomon explains the city actually stands on the back of a Primal Turtle and that he had asked her to wander off (so Slupper would help him).

He asks her to surface and walk back, in exchange for release and a good word from the rest.

And so the turtle city surfaces again as an island.

Vivienne reveals more is going on with her. She'll never grow old, it could never have worked out between her and Slupper. They say goodbye. (She doesn't explain exactly what's up with her.)

Socipi indeed admits to having switched the books. He remembers what was in the original, which he lost, explaining the final holes in the story: Primal Turtles hatch from an egg during the First Ice Age, strengthened by the gods so it would survive. But they became too strong, so the gods pulled the emergency brake and submerged the city underwater.

(Socipi also tells about a city of shells they're building somewhere else underwater => for a future story.)

## 10. Epilogue
Council of Turtles votes on Solomon. The Wise Owl is the judge this time.

It's a beautiful open area with rivers, plants, soils, etcetera to support all animal species. They each have one companion with one vote.

Lion tries to influence her. Slupper tries to influence her.

Companion Akez---the shark from the beginning---testifies and claims he saw through Solomon and wanted nothing to do with his mission.

They vote: Lock Solomon away.

But the Wolf Companion proposes to banish him and revoke his companionship. That's more reasonable.

Everyone votes yes. Slupper becomes the new companion for _land turtles_, Socipi the new companion for _sea turtles_

Everyone is happy. Except that lion: he holds back the judge and threatens consequences.
