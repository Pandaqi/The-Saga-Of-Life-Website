## Outline

* **Chapter 1:** introduction sloth paradise and protagonist, new human arrives (this is Mindy), tension
* **Chapter 2:** as she researches them, they try to get her to touch the Flamefeaster and be gone. Only our protagonist trusts her and they make a plan to find this "wish granter" together
* **Chapter 3:** they search through paradise, talking a bit more and explaining a bit more, but only stumble upon Ismaraldah. Meanwhile, the other sloths have overcome their struggles to _meet up_ and decide what to do with this human. They decide they don't trust her and she has to go.
* **Chapter 4:** Ismaraldah helps them with more information about wish granter. The human claims that she has realized the reason for their curse _and_ a possible _cure_! She eagerly starts to work on it, with the sloths trying to help, but they come too late and she walks away forgetful.
* **Chapter 5:** A new human arrives. This time, they all trust her immediately, and start explaining their paradise and keeping her away from the curse. Until the human _does_ get into trouble ... and it's revealed that they have their own protection against it.
* **Chapter 6:** The protagonist calls upon Ismaraldah. They spy on the new humans and discover their secret plans to destroy the whole thing AND their access to the wish granter. They get found out, and in the resulting scuffle/fight Ismaraldah and Didrik both get caught in the curse.
* **Chapter 7:** They rapidly go through ways to solve it, while trying to gain access to the wish granter. The humans make progress on their plans, destroying the first few trees. The other sloths still refuse to do anything or even talk with the protagonist, for fear of burning out their relationship.
* **Chapter 8:** They find and use the wish granter. But it reveals itself to be the fake I explained before.
* **Chapter 9:** big climax as the humans destroy the trees, the protagonist tries to rally everyone and have them _do_ something about it, and Ismaraldah+Didrik help but also try to fix themselves before they forget each other.
* **Chapter 10:** in the end, many sloths (and humans) _have_ forgotten each other, but the paradise is saved. One instance of that "protection" the humans had against the curse is saved and given to the protagonist. (They decide to keep the Flamefeaster as protection for themselves?) Ismaraldah + Didrik flee to execute their plan. Many sloths still decide to tell their wish to the fake wish granter, because getting rid of it still makes them happier. ("Desire is the cause of all suffering.")

Good quote (voor tweede chunk natuurlijk): "Als bomen internet zouden geven, zou iedereen ze overal planten en nooit omhakken; jammer genoeg geven ze alleen de zuurstof die we nodig hebben om te overleven."
