## Outline

This is a possible combination of the ideas.
* The ill protagonist is extremely rich. Maybe they're royal family, or noble, or something close. That's how they can _pay_ for all those "advanced healers" and stuff. But all that money does not actually cure her. 
	* **Inciting Incident:** find a cure or die. (Urgent, certain loss, goal is to survive, obstacle is the illness.)
* The other protagonist comes from a very poor background. She is cast out, alone, nearly dying from hunger and cold.
	* **Inciting Incident:** her goal is to belong to the group, giving her safety and food. (Urgent, certain loss, goal is to survive, obstacle is the fact she has nothing to offer)
	* She _lies_ about someone and gets them drowned for being a witch, just to belong to the group. ("Yes! I was there. This woman had a room full of skeletons and a potion brewing!")
	* She invents something, but asks the other to really stay quiet about it or she's called a witch, just to belong to the group.
	* But now that she belongs, she obviously has to take over their opinions and their ideas. And they especially despise those rich noble families.

In all of this, there's the lesson of **no learning without failing** => they constantly try something, fail to reach their end goal, then must pick up the pieces to try again

This is more like it. Over time, the ill one will seek out help from those that are supposed to "despise" her (coming in contact with the other one), as the other gets involved more and more deeply in lies and potential giveaways that might mark her a witch. This culminates in both being tracked down, caught after a chase, and burned at the stake / drowned / whatever witch trial they come up with.

But an invention helps them survive and combining powers, finishing their experiments, finds a cure for her illness just in time.

(And, as stated, some plot twists about people _knowing_ everyone is lying and still going along. And how that has stifled progression in forever. The cure is probably something obvious and simple---maybe one of the others stumbled onto it "by accident" before, but was afraid to let it be known, for fear of being called a witch!)

**@IDEA: "living in denial".** One character drinks way too much (alcohol). But they come from a family where _all_ of them do that, so they're like "I don't drink any more than anyone else! This is alright!" Even as they decline further and further, get more and more ill, etcetera. 

Even when they're _treated_ for it, their family keeps secretly getting them more alcohol, until they die without ever even realizing the truth?
