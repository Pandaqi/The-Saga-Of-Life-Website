## Outline

* Chapters 1--5 are about Chandragupta and the Tamil kings resisting. (The Tamil kings being merchants claiming the shorelines of India and becoming unbelievably rich through that trade. Which helps when trying to defend yourself.)
* Chapters 6--10 are about his son trying to do the same thing, then making that unexpected shift.
* End on hint towards Gupta Empire and golden age of India?

Main character 1 = older person of Tamli kings, actually befriends Chandra ( = Gupra) in the end and is sad to see him go (through fasting)?

Main character 2 = Gupra => They MET Alexander the Great and scared him off

Main character 3 = Ashoka

Main character 4 = young daughter of Tamli kings who eventually dies

@IDEA: Make the narrator really obvious in this one. They keep foreshadowing, referring back, making jokes about how the Tamli can't be conquered, they tell it like a fairy tale.

In all of this, the most logical main character is one of those Tamil kings. They are the ones in danger of being conquered, they are the ones fighting for their lives/territory, and their legacy actually lives on until this day. This is a story about successfully defending yourself, dotted with "funny" or "unexpected" ways in which the Tamil kings just _will not be conquered_ :p (Maybe the gods have something to do with that.)

(On top of that, I can bring the Tamil kings back in later stories this cycle, showing they are _still not conquered_!)

I did, however, write something else in my notes. Each story in this cycle has a general "life lesson".

The one for this story was "no love without loss" or "no love without vulnerability" (which is more true but doesn't sound as great).

And yes, the Saga of Life _is_ lacking some good love stories!

So here's the idea.

* There's this woman from the Tamils who is just breathtakingly beautiful and amazing in general.
* Ashoka actually _gets_ her, but casts her aside and doesn't really give her any time or attention.
* She obviously fights his invasion and dies in the process.
* Ashoka now realizes what he had and feels such overwhelming love that he completely changes his ways.
