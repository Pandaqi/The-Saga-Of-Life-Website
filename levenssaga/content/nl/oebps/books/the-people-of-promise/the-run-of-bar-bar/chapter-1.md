## Outline

As such, the vague outline for the story became ...

* A group of Roman elites secretly seeks out Barbarians. They ask them to do a "barbaric task": kill their own leader. He is a terrible leader and leading the empire into ruin.
* We follow one storyline where they discuss, plan the mission, then try to execute it.
* We follow another storyline where a Roman, obsessed with order and civilization, tries to depose the leader using "legal" methods.
* At first, the Barbarians are unsure, and the Roman seems to make headway.
* But when he gets too close to _actually_ changing anything, he is attacked an incarcerated.
* This exact event---seeing how justice is perverted when the king feels threatened---is what _convinces_ the barbarians to complete their mission.

So yes. The Saga of Life is getting a Lawyer storyline mixed with a Heist storyline. Let's not think too far ahead and just start writing that.

(I really want to make more characters reappear between stories. It feels a little too disconnected now. So I'll try to make the shepherds from the previous story in this time period relevant somehow. Also, my notes state that the Romans and Barbarians were being pushed around by the relentless Huns at this time, so let's keep that as a consistent threat driving things.)

Our final check: do we have a goal, an obstacle ( = conflict), that is urgent and with potential loss?
* The goal is to remove the terrible leader before they make a bigger mess. (Perhaps they're planning an all-out attack, with the ENTIRE army, to wipe the Barbarians off the face of the earth for good.)
* The obstacle is the leader itself, having all the power.
* It is urgent, for the leader makes these terrible decisions all day and will enact their plan soon. (Perhaps they are "visiting" some town nearby that makes this moment the best one ... for a brief window of time.)
* If the barbarians don't do it, they lose good relations with Rome and/or their entire lifestyle.
* If the lawyer doesn't win, he will be crushed by his destroyed faith in civilization and law. (Figuratively. Though it becomes literal when he is sentenced to death.)
