"Het Rijk van Otto" (beschaving): Het Ottomaanse Rijk dat lekker doorgaat met delen innemen, Islam verspreiden, lekker groot worden, spanningen tussen geloven weer laat opbloeien. Ze snijden Europa af van "the silk road" (en de rest van de spices/handelroutes daar) => Een grote reden waarom Columbus uiteindelijk vertrekt.

**@TODO: Ergens het idee behandelen dat mensen van nature "overwinnaars" onthouden en vereren.** Enerzijds zit dat dus in onze natuur, om kracht, macht, etcetera te idoliseren. Anderzijds hebben ze natuurlijk veel gebied veroverd en dus veel mensen bereikt. => Vrijwel niemand onthoudt grote uitvinders van cruciale dingen, of die ene persoon die vrede hield voor duizend jaar door goede beslissingen.







My first instinct? Some kind of "guiding star". In all decisions made, through the centuries, some guiding star leads the way for our protagonist and helps the empire grow. => This starts as a literal guiding star, then turns figurative by following the Moon Goddess?

I also think we could go for the perspective of one such boy recruited in that "devsirme" system. Their initial fear, torn from family, brainwashed. How they climb the ladder and actually get a powerful position.

We do need a second perspective for the moments _before_ (and potentially _after_) this boy's recruitment. This should be an _artist_ or _scientist_ woman, showing off the advancements and standardization. 
* Let's make her a _(half) goddess of the Moon_. 
* Her control of the tides helps their naval dominance and sea trade. (This is a mystery that gets revealed somewhere.)
* Every night, she paints the moon. She also puts the Moon in _everything_ she makes, from architecture, to poems, to laws, etcetera.
* She has the burning desire inside her to find the _(half) god of the Sun_?
* She is like the "guiding star" of Otto, helping him make decisions and actually keeping the empire from imploding several times?
* **She has discussions with him about Love being the odd one out.** Love causes you to act against self-interest, just because you love someone. Love causes you to do what you otherwise couldn't.
	* "Would you die for me?" she asked.
	* "Yes," Enra replied without missing a beat.
	* "_Why?_" she said with curious wide eyes. "There's nothing to gain. You are dead. I am but one person without power."
	* Enra stayed silent. "Because ... because I feel it."
	* "Love?"
	* "Something."


Here's a vague outline.
* Chapter 1 = leader is presumed dead, their sons all pipe up and nearly kill each other to get the throne. Until the leader returns alive and realizes this just won't work. They call their current laws and systems completely _void_ and start from scratch.
	* (As that boy obviously hasn't entered the story yet, such scenes are from the perspective of that Moon goddess.)
	* This starts out as a **mystery/investigation:** WHO made the false claim the king was dead?
* Chapter 2 = That boy is recruited for the "devsirme" and ends up in the empire.
* Chapter 3-6 = The boy slowly regains strength and starts to climb ranks. We make time jumps as the empire grows, we get references to other empires, etcetera.
	* Around chapter 6 = Columbus and such start their routes (to prevent trade being choked), Renaissance kicks off
* Midpoint = They stage a successful revolt (perhaps after a failed one) and undo the devsirme system, seizing a lot of power at once.
* Chapter 7-8 = the last of the Habsburgs (Charles II) enters the story (mostly to come back to the "inbreeding" and "that's why people need to move around" thing from story 2)
	* However, the power struggles that entered the empire weaken it and make it shrink.
	* Their advancements and freedom is rapidly scaled back to put all resources into warfare and nothing else.
* Chapter 9 = World war 1 is shaping up. Our two protagonists make _some_ huge decision here.
	* Here's an idea: this one night, she is shocked to see there is no moon (or "the moon looks/feels wrong"). This causes them to flee just in time.
	* As their empire is bombed behind them, they realize that aircraft from the enemy was hiding the moon from view. They're one of the few to survive this event.
	* **@IDEA (There's A Light That Will Never Go Out): (perhaps introduced earlier)** Moon is always the only one with her lights on during the night, as she paints the moon. She says: "As long as my light is on, I will love you. Come in time and we'll run away together" => Or maybe "her light" is just a metaphor for her moon, which does NOT appear this one evening.
* Chapter 10 = the empire is defeated at the end of World War 1. It's dissolved into tiny chunks, basically leading to the MIddle-Eastern conflicts we know today.
	* Het Rijk van Otto moet wel echt inzetten hoe dat hele midden-oosten uit elkaar viel toen het rijk plots stopte.

The general lesson of this story is "No power without the powerless", which might be amended with a general lesson about pursuing "useless" things (like art) because you never know when they might be useful.

This is still quite vague. I'll need to figure out the details of the powers, the specific scenes, etcetera as we go.

(Like, how do we get to see the scenes at the other side of the world, with Columbus and such? Does that goddess perhaps influence the waves to make Columbus end up at the wrong continent?)

@TODO: **connect** this star idea with the stars from the final story (Holbewoners).

@TODO: get more **out of** this idea of a "complete reset of law/country" (and baggage you take with you from before)

@TODO: mention wanting to conquer the Tamli, then someone saying "ah forget it, believe me"

@TODO: Have the Goddess' art be an invaluable _trading tool_! Someone offers to pay a lot of money, or will have peace, if they can have her paintings. But then they get lost at sea? (As the icon shows?)
* At the same time, her moon / sun are crucial to _navigation_ (both across land and sea) => **@IDEA:** In a big plot twist, she _hides_ the moon, confusing all sailors and completely disrupting the trade.
* Enra is fine with the potential to shipwreck here because "to die by your side, the pleasure the privilige is mine"
* She regularly meets Enra and tells him stories about someone who tried to "go it alone" (as he does) and failed miserably in our history. (She's in love with him of course, he denies and doesn't want it, also because he reveals he "can't have kids" later.)
* "But I can't give you children!" "It is not a _trade_! It is _love_. I want nothing from you. I just want to give all I have and see you happy."
* "Why do you stay, Moon? You're miles better than anyone here?" "You really don't understand?" (She mostly stays for Enra at this point.)
 
@TODO (Optional): About the origins of the star-and-crescent, which basically go back to Sumer/Mesopotamia and people just kept copying it.

@TODO: The other protagonist is called **Enra**, as in "not-Ra". A very bad attempt by their parents to hide that they're the goddess of Sun.

@TODO: Otto spreekt over Alixader als "groots" en idoliseert, wat de rest dus tegenspreekt met "hij is alleen groots omdat wij veroveraars blijkbaar leuk vinden"

@TODO: The idea that it's always easier to be the underdog and fight a guerilla war, than being the big empire. Eventually, everyone gets too big and gets attacked from all sides, and it always leads to their downfall (this goes almost in predictable cycles).

"You can get my forced labor or my voluntary loyalty, not both." -Enra.
