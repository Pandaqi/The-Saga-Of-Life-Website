Most creatures are nomads

traveling from place to place

for if the food runs out right here

they simply find an untouched space

&nbsp;

But the Jagu Tribe received a godly gift

Plundered the area for all its treasures

The Asha Tribe must enter cooperation swift

Or survival would require unprecedented measures
