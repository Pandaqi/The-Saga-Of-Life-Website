An illness pulls Catia's body apart

A mysterious disappearance turns Felicia homeless

Both their fates burn bad to worse

Which forbidden witch ritual will heal their heart?

&nbsp;

In secrecy their fates are intertwined

In a Medieval city that chokes on its own lies

Beneath pressure and deceit, because all hate witches

But nobody knows, exactly, what a witch is
