A land forgotten by an explorer and thief

Contained fifty Treetowers beautiful beyond belief

Flowers in bloom and Branchbridges that weave

If you'd known the place, you'd never want to leave

&nbsp;

Beauty paid a price, though, shaped like a Curse

And when humans appear in their midst on accident

They don't know if those monsters will help or make it worse

But if they don't conquer their laziness, that surely spells the end
