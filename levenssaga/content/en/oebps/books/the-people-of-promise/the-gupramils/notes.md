With each cycle of the Saga of Life, I really try to show all possible sides of one (important) topic. This story initially came to life because of that philosophy.

Almost all people are _against_ war and fighting, or conflict in general. Who in their right mind wants more dead people and more pain? And still ... war and fighting can be _good_. It can be done with noble intentions. It can be done to defend yourself. It can be stopped if it goes too far.

This is how I stumbled upon the true stories of Chandragupta and his grandson Ashoka. Both were leaders and warmongers, but in a very interesting way. The fact that this happened in India---the same location as the previous two stories---made this the definitive choice.

(In Europa and America we like to think civilization started with us, but Asia is truly the cradle of civilization in almost all ways. The Chinese dynasty had already written epic stories before the Roman Empire was even conceived.)

The story of Chandragupta who united India---after years of infighting between all the provinces and cities---is true. That he fasted to death out of sympathy for his starving subjects is also true.

The story of Ashoka who mercilessly killed all remaining enemies in India is also true, just as the fact that he suddenly _stopped_ and completely changed his ways. One of the few examples in our history of a great leader who actually learned from their mistakes, gained new insight, and did his best to course correct from now on.

This time period is roughly called the "Gupta Empire" or the "Golden Age of India". Although a term like _Golden Age_ usually sends the wrong message---this civilization also had major flaws---it's still fitting. India was relatively open and peaceful, allowing them to make great progress with science and inventions. Ashoka even allowed other faiths and philosophies.

Until, as the story indicates, the fearsome Huns walked all over everyone. More on that soon ...

And yes, the three Tamil Kings do have a legend that they would _never be conquered_. And the Tamil culture is still alive now, in the same way, at the same location at the southern tip of India. So in a way, the legend is still right.

Besides these truths I obviously invented and modified history to make the story more interesting or streamlined. As always, if you want to know more, do your own research about these odd characters and ancient time periods.

## Characters

* **Gupra** (Elephant): inspired by the real _Chandragupta_. Obsessed with conquering Schola for a noble purpose: unite them and improve their lives. Cares so much that the fasts to death out of solidarity with his subjects.
* **Ashorra** (Elephant): inspired by the real _Ashoka_. Has been able to see the _Deathmate_ of others since he was young, and even hear messages from his own. It drives him insane and gives him a bad reputation. Over time, after losing his grandfather and then his lovely wife, he learns the meaning of this and turns his feelings of revenge around.
* **Marili** (Elephant): a beautiful and skilled elephant of the Tamli. Is forced into a relationship with Ashorra, but ends up loving him more than he does her. Until she's given him enough time to change his ways and goes back home.
* **Mero** (Tiger): commander (and second most important creature) of the Gupramil Army. Seen as the _true_ successor of Gupra, for nobody trusts Ashorra. Until the grandson kills him in an act of fury because Mero wants to seize power and never give it back. In reality, Ashoka killed his _father_ for the same reason.
* **Ardex** (Sabre-toothed Tiger): our favorite eldest demigod.
* **Alixader the Giant** (Sabretaur): inspired by the real _Alexander the Great._ (He actually met Gupra and all, but I mostly wanted to include him as setup for later.)

And then we have our three Tamli kings, of course. Rhinos who swim in gold, true traders who don't desire more ground, but do want to protect their own folk. They seem to have a weird magical protection that always makes them _lucky_ and causes them to never be conquered.

* **Are** (Rhino): somewhat childish and playful, but can still use common sense and (fighting) skill when needed.
* **Beeris** (Rhino): eldest, smartest, most serious, takes charge when needed. Has the largest army, but is also most diplomatic.
* **Candya** (Rhino): youngest, very childish, does not take anything seriously.
