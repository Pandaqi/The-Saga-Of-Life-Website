After years of fighting, divided

Between brother, sister, neighbor

One leader aims to see Schola united

And bring back the peace from before

&nbsp;

But one territory keeps resisting

No matter their exceptional plans for defeat

And his successor is tormented by ghosts

Which means nobody wants to ever see him lead
