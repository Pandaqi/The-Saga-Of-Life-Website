The Amor king has gone mad

Giving commands mean, terrible and bad

He's gone insane, so many moan

But how to kick kings off of their own throne?

&nbsp;

A Barbaric mission starts for the better

A lawyer throws the book of law at the matter

But is this mission even just or right

Or is this the downfall of civilization's might?
