Casbrita had sent a new boatload of soldiers to keep Bosnot in check. They also removed the ability of colonies to govern themselves. In practice, all decisions in the colonies were now made directly by the parliament in Casbrita---on the other side of the world.

The increased presence of soldiers forced the _Children of Freedom_ to leave their caf√©. Fortunately, all the rich founders had an estate somewhere, and Ajay did not trust anyone's home but his own, so they went there. 

Jefizon realized that they _had_ been lucky so far, and they'd need even more luck if they wanted to win against the incredible force of Casbrita. Their guns were so primitive that they could not hold a bayonet. Their ammunition was almost depleted. The Casbrita soldiers outnumbered them 100 to 1. He'd once read about a Demigod of Luck, and he really hoped to find the good man someday.

Jefizon and Fuja immediately picked out a bedroom together.

Until Ajay came between them. He leaned in the doorway, his strict eyes on the couple.

"Stop this," he said. "Either you end the relationship, or you can both go."

"That is absurd, Ajay," Jefizon said, holding Fuja.

"Then go and never come back," he said, his left hand pointing at the exit.

"After all we've done for the rebels?" Jefizon said in disbelief. "Now that we're winning?"

"You see, love makes you blind," Ajay growled. "We are _not_ winning. Our joke with the tea has chased us out of Bosnot. And I have proof that Fuja is a spy."

"Yes. For us."

"OUT!"

Jefizon and Fuja released each other's warm hands. After a long silence, Fuja was first to speak.

"I fear ... that we should not see each other any longer," she said. Then she left, crying.

Jefizon stayed behind, angry and alone. Ajay seemed satisfied, until Jefizon walked past him and bumped his shoulder hard.

"I don't trust a revolution where love isn't allowed."

When Jefizon came downstairs, Fuja was already gone. She wouldn't leave completely, right? Had he ... had he read the signals in her eyes correctly? She secretly wanted to stay together?

The door opened and a long-lost member of the rebels entered. Benni Fracclin, a bit fatter than last time, but just as joyful and charismatic.

"Ah, Jefizon! You look as if the clouds are about to murder you. Let me cheer you up with good news: our inventors think they've found an improvement to our pistols. Soon, we'll shoot faster and better than Casbrita!"

Ajay descended the stairs and called everyone together for an important meeting. Until he saw Fracclin.

"Benni, you must stop your visits to the science fairs."

He frowned. "What now again?"

"And leave the Elwar Council of Inventors."

Fracclin shook his head. "Won't happen, Ajay. I never thought you would fear _scientists_!"

"You are _freaks_. Your reputation makes all the rebels look silly and insane. Stop it."

Fracclin studied the others. He had a bald forehead, which the back of his head seemed to compensate by growing very long hairs that already turned grey. He'd never been a fighter or a hero, but probably the most clever and warm person in the rebellion.

"Oh come on," Wasserbox said. "You're not---"

"I would think a soldier like you _understood_ the harsh decisions made by a boss. Me, Ajay, the boss."

Wasserbox laughed. "Who must repeat they are boss, is not---"

"Have you ever read a book? Or used your brain cells?" Jefizon sneered. "Wasserbox is known for listening to everyone's advice. It is _good_ to speak out against your boss if they are about to make a big mistake. The _only_ thing the leader does, and this is a noble deed not to be abused, is make the final decisions."

Ajay was silent for a while.

"Well, then, my _final decision_ is that Fracclin must stop his wizard work and Fuja can stay away. Didn't trust her from the start."

If there'd been a vote, nobody would have picked Ajay as leader. But Ajay _founded_ these rebels, took care of all the logistics, and had the most money and connections to make it all happen.

And so, with a depressed mood, everyone took their places in a circle around Ajay.

"What important news?" Bardams asked. As usual, they'd all forgotten he was here.

"The call has come," Ajay said with a smile. "Philadinna. The biggest leaders and thinkers of each colony have been invited to gather there. They call it the _Continental Congress_. We will discuss how we can cooperate and rule Elwar once Casbrita is gone."

"_If_ Casbrita can be removed," Jefizon said.

"It will happen," Ajay replied confidently.

Fracclin coughed and had a crooked smile. "Are you sure you want to forbid me from ... doing my sidejobs outside of the rebellions?"

Ajay frowned. "Yes. I thought I was clear."

"And what if I tell you that _I_ came up with this idea and pulled the strings to make this entire darn congress happen? Still want me to stop doing that, Ajay?"

He fell silent, face blank, then turned around and left.

___

The intention was to send _one_ person, where Fracclin was the obvious choice. But Jefizon wanted to come too. And Bardams. And Ajay obviously would not send his best rebels without being there himself to check what they were doing.

And so, all of them arrived in Philadinna. All colonies had sent their best representatives. For some, this meant the governors of their biggest cities---at least, before they were removed and replaced by an animal that favored Casbrita more. For others, this meant important soldiers or philosophers like Bardams.

In the end, a large room was filled with animals. Some who knew everything about laws and governing a land, and some who knew how to defeat an enemy army. Everyone was allowed to speak and give their thoughts.

But the rebels were surprised about what was said.

All the other colonies wanted to _repair_ relations with Casbrita. Negotiate an advantageous peace, open up trade again, and strengthen the colonies that way.

Their only luck was that Bardams and Jefizon were recognized as perhaps the most important beings there. Their achievements, degrees and genius made them almost the boss of the Congress. They were able to give a counter-narrative.

"And what if Casbrita never wants peace?" Bardams said. "Then we weaken ourselves while they strike!"

"The distance is their problem," Jefizon added. "New troops from Casbrita must travel by sea, for months, before they arrive here. We might send a proposal for peace ... while they've already sent a thousand ships our way. They'll laugh at our faces!"

"We are in _no_ condition to fight Casbrita," another voice said. "Our soldiers are loose squads of fathers and sons, spread over the colonies. Our economy has ground to a halt because Casbrita stopped importing anything! No, peace is the first path to try."

"Then think of the _principle_," Bardams said. "No animal should be owned or controlled by another. The colonies should belong to those who live there, not the Casbrita far away. We must free ourselves out of _principle_. We could be the _first country_ in the world where dictators and kings are removed forever! Like we should've abolished slavery long ago."

This received a stronger reaction. Especially in the southern colonies, where they lived almost entirely off of the back of slave labor. The entire area was filled with plantations that grew luxury products like cotton and sugar. Farmed by slaves. 

In the end, the Congress lasted for six weeks. That was the downside of giving everyone their turn to speak.

Wasserbox was there, but said nothing. Ajay had forbidden him from traveling with them, at first, but then he was invited individually by _other_ Congressmembers because they recognized his military brilliance. Then Wasserbox had asked Pikan to join, the rhino who used to be Bardams' slave, because he was impressed with his military prowess. So now even slaves were allowed to hear all their secret discussions!

Ajay wondered if everyone had gone insane and forgotten Wasserbox' past at Casbrita, because he surely hadn't.

The Congress could only agree on two things. All soldiers had to be ready to fight at a moment's notice. And they'd quickly hold a new Congress, if their peace proposal was rejected by Casbrita.

The rebels traveled back home in their coachwagon, pulled by six horses. Bardams found this usage of horses abominable too, but had to admit that the distance was too great for walking. Even the most expensive wagon would take weeks.

Especially if, miles before your destination, you were ambushed by a group of natives.

The Elwari blocked the path and yelled to get their attention. They kept weapons ready, but didn't point them at the wagon yet. The horses refused to continue walking through two large tepees ahead of them.

Wasserbox was brave enough to jump out the wagon instantly.

"Is there a problem?" he asked calmly. "Or shall we call this an unfortunate meeting and we'll take a different route home?"

From the crowd of natives, Fuja appeared. Jefizon jumped out of the wagon too at the sight of her smiling face.

"There is a problem. But you are lucky again, because you're just in time for a surprise attack."
