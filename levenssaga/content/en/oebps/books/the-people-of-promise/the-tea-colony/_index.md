Now that their oppressors are out of coin

They squeeze their colonies for every cent

The poor inhabitants left with empty land

Until all able soldiers are asked to join

&nbsp;

Clever heads combine in need

While rebels rally and perform a brave deed

But when Casbrita brings their full force to the fight

Who will end up with all of Elwar's might?
