Casbrita obviously claimed that Elwar didn't have the _right_ to declare itself independent. The colonies were theirs and they'd let them know. Wasserbox moved the entire army in preparation, to New Bork, which was now their largest and most important city. If Casbrita attacked, it would be there.

Most of the world, however, did accept. Mostly because they still hated Casbrita because of earlier wars.

The largest among them was Frambozi. All that time, Fracclin had tried to convince the Frambozi king to support Elwar in the war. They were fine with secretly sending weapons and ammunition, but never officially declared their support. Not while they weren't sure that Elwar would actually win.

And Casbrita was certain they wouldn't win. All the colonies were located on the coast and received most of their goods from ships. And what did the Continental Army lack? Ships. Casbrita had the most powerful fleet in the world and the rebels merely had some rafts. The Parliament laughed at them and predicted the colonies would be theirs again in a few years.

The war wasn't over. No, it had only just started.

Jefizon walked with Beeris over his estate. He'd just shown his enormous library to him, while failing to reveal how broke he'd become from all those purchases. The salary he'd received for writing the Declaration had been completely spent on designing his own dream home. 

He'd also started writing his own version of Le Bjib, the holy book of Krystanism, without all the miracles and with only the "good parts". To him, Yesis Kryst was not a messiah but a philosopher worth studying. 

Fuja painted beautiful flags and hung them on every wall she could find. To celebrate their independence, partially thanks to Jefizon's powerful writing.

Elwar held these ideas to be self-evident. The rest of the world---where each country was still rules by strict kings or mad dictators---laughed at them for the entire _idea_ of freedom and independence.

"I own one very odd book," Jefizon said. "I suspect it might have belonged to the godchildren. It almost seems magical. It contains probably the entire history of Somnia up to this point!"

"That sounds like the Book of Meaning," Beeris said. "My mother used to talk about it, when she was still ..."

Jefizon placed one hand on Beeris' back, the other holding a cup of tea.

"What the world did to the godchildren is horrible. Mostly, though, I noticed just how _unlucky_ they were. The victors in war are usually not the _best_ or _strongest_. No, it's those who had the most luck. Those for whom events went _just_ the right way."

Jefizon looked at the rhino, puzzled. "Though I do wonder, my good man, why you did not help your parents? Or how you ever became a slave? That sounds ... more than unfortunate."

"I was too young, too unsure in my power, to help my parents survive that war. And I am Demigod of Luck, not Demigod of Total Control. I couldn't prevent becoming a slave---I did influence fortune just enough to become a well-treated slave of a kind man called Bardams."

Beeris looked out at the beautifully designed gardens. Jefizon had released all his slaves and horses, though some had voluntarily returned as a paid employee. Elwar was a beautiful land, now supported by beautiful---though imperfect---laws.

"You have no idea how close the world has come, time and time again, to a devilish leader who'd bring us all to ruin. The Amorian Empire? Ottojon? One fewer storm, one unfortunate decision, and those empires might have ruled all of Somnia now."

Jefizon froze. "But, wait, aren't you thousands of years old then?"

"Yes." He shrugged. "Lucky with my genes, right?"

He waved at Fuja, who seemed happier than ever, despite having less freedom than before. Fuja and Jefizon had agreed to not jump into battles or war ever again. To always confer with each other first, to let each other know when they left the estate, to be selective in who they trusted and how they lived for their own safety. The conversation hadn't been long---both agreed they wanted this immediately.

"Take good care of each other. I wish you two the best of _luck_."

The Demigod of Luck walked away.

The _Children of Freedom_ had to be reformed, including Ajay who was called a hero for delivering the cannons. This time, though, it would not be a select group of rebels, no rich young man in a caf√© dreaming of freedom, but a part of a greater whole: the Continental Army that fought for all three colonies.

That Casbrita would attack in full force now, that was a certainty.
