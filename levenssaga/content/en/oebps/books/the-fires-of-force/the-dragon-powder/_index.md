In the history of mankind, there were many explosions

Such as the one where life suddenly quadrupled in the oceans

Or the one that wiped out dinosaurs, mighty though they be

But biggest of all came from a chemist and unwavering belief

&nbsp;

The tragedy of the dragons was a myth oft-heard

It founded a strong nation, some say the first

Who would dare fight them, when the beasts came for your home?

An explosion is bound to come, and they rarely come alone
