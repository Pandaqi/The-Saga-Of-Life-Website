This story started with the famous "legend" of emperor Nero who supposedly caused The Great Fire of Rome. I learned about that event when I was just a little boy, and I obviously had to include it in my Saga of Life when I made my first outlines.

When it came time to actually _write_ this, however, I was now 15 years older and did much more research. And I discovered that "legend" is perhaps the right word. I was reminded of the fact that history is often written by the victors (_they're still alive_) and the elite (_they can actually read and write_). 

I noticed a cycle of historic events where some emperor or king was actually quite _good_, doing good things for the common folk. This angered the elite, the nobles, the rich---because helping poor people obviously meant not helping them---so they invented tales to harm them. Or simply assassinated them. But because _they_ wrote the history, we believed those kings were bad and rightly assassinated. It took us a while to find evidence to the contrary.

As such, I changed this idea to be more about _that_. To show the events before and after Nero. To show leadership, betrayal, and more, instead of just that one disaster. I also did this to prevent becoming repetitive, with several stories (in this cycle) focusing on large fires getting out of hand ;)

(The idea to tell the story from the perspective of Tresmo was something I wanted to do at _some point_ anyway. I also try to have ~2 stories per cycle with a really weird structure. Thus, I decided to apply that idea to _this_ story.)

## Agrippina vs The Empire
The story of Nero really starts with the decade before him. Julius Caesar is betrayed, and chaos ensues, for nobody knows who leads the Roman Republic now. To keep it from falling apart, the new leader (Augustus) gives himself more and more power.

As far as we know, Augustus was a good leader with good intentions, and the increase of his own power was necessary to stabilize the Romans. But it also made him a lone emperor---it was now the Roman Empire. 

And every emperor after him, saw what Augustus had done, and thought "great idea, I want to become even more powerful!" They build even larger palaces for themselves than their predecessor. They were even less subtle about gathering riches and only satisfying themselves.

And so it happened that, by the time Nero was born, the emperor of the Roman Empire was basically a dictator who could do whatever they pleased.

Liking the sound of this job, Nero's mother Agrippina started murdering and betraying left and right, until Nero suddenly ended up on the throne. He probably hadn't expected it either.

Nero was handsome, well-liked, and well-intentioned. There is clear evidence pointing to the many good laws he instated that benefited the poor, the common folk, those who actually needed it. There are accounts of several attempts to assassinate Nero, which were foiled before they got anywhere because the people were so loyal to him.

But the elite felt left behind. And they envied Nero for his position on the throne. The problematic part: most of what we know about this part of history was _written down_ by those elite.

And Agrippina? Well, she basically tried to rule _through_ Nero, keeping an iron grip on what he did and said. This hampered his abilities and made him increasingly eager to remove his mother altogether.

## The Great Fire of Rome
In truth, Rome had been one big fire hazard for years. Several smaller fires had already broken out. Repeatedly, people warned Nero of a possible looming disaster. He ignored extremely sensible warnings, as humans all tend to do, somehow.

And so it was that Nero killed his own mother. And not long after, a great fire broke out when he wasn't in the city himself.

This fed the rumor that he actually caused the fire. Several accounts talk of him _singing_ as the fire raged, which everyone interpreted as some sort of evil cackling over what he'd done. In reality, it might just have been a way to keep up morale. (Like people singing when they're scared.)

He returned quickly to help firefighting efforts. It was only some fifty years earlier that Rome finally acquired its first proper police and firefighting force: the _Vigiles_. (From which we get the word _Vigilante_, nowadays associated with superhero stories.) 

Unfortunately, they just decided to create even more fires and loot all buildings in the chaos. (Not very superheroey. Though might be an interesting spin to shake up the genre ...)

And so the fire raged for days and destroyed 10 out of 14 districts of Rome.

Nero quickly passed sensible laws to prevent this in the future. Seeking to deflect blame, he tried to convince everyone it was the Christians---a new religion, a minority in Rome. (Remember this is all ~60 AD. Jesus Christ had only just died for our supposed sins.)

The elite were done. Killing his mother, torturing Christians, building a massive palace for himself on the ashes, even killing his own mentor/tutor (Seneca) that supported him all that time.

They decide to declare Nero "public enemy". Which means he may be killed by anyone, no questions asked. They spin it in such a way that it gets the support of the common folk, who thus far had loved Nero and had seen their lives greatly improve under his leadership.

Nero flees in fear and commits suicide.

## Why this story?
Now, it is very interesting to me how almost everyone knows about Nero. He is synonymous with fire, madness, disaster, greedy leaders. But when you assemble as many facts as possible, all you see is a well-intentioned boy, put on the throne by a crazy mother, who did some good things and some bad things. 

His biggest mistake? Angering the elite. Angering others vying for that throne. Not actually some terrible laws or disconnect from his people.

_The Great Fire of Rome was a massive disaster_. It was also, likely, nothing else _but a disaster_. Rome was built in a way that made such a massive fire almost a certainty. It had to happen at _some point_. There is no concrete _evidence_ that Nero caused it or hampered firefighting efforts. There have been dozens of these destructive fires in history, and they all led to _better_ protocols and actual _firefighters_ afterwards. The risky and deadly version of "you live and you learn".

But now, two thousand years later, anybody who recognizes the name _Nero_ thinks of a great fire and a terrible emperor. Because history is written by the ones who had cause to hate him.

That's why I decided on my trick with the narration. All scenes told from Tresmo's viewpoint are _true_. All other scenes were _written_ on papyrus made from Tresmo's bark, which is how he knows it, but ... all of that might just have been rumors spread by some petty elite.

It's a good tale. And one that shows the need to be critical. Of history, yes, but also of any news you might hear today. Always ask questions, always seek the _evidence_, always seek for _multiple sources_. Or you might end up believing what's not true and causing a lot of pain, death or misguided legends now or even thousands of years later.

(It's also one of the reasons I dropped the need to be extremely accurate in my Saga of Life stories. Because, even with the Saga being as young as it is, there have already been stories that I based on research ... which later proved to be false. Or more nuanced. As we get more sources, as we learn more about history and science, I am sure some things in the Saga will simply be proven _wrong_ in a hundred years time. That's progress. I don't mind. But it's why I play fast and loose with the current facts on which I base these tales.)
