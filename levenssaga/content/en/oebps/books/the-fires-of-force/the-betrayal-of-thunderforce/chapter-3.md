As Amor had grown, the eternal fires around Tresmo had acquired a third meaning---besides _Sneaky Spot_ and _Funeral Fires_. Whenever anything official had to happen, anything that required the "eyes of the gods to witness", they would do it in front of Tresmo too. They both believed he was _dead_ as well as _a god_, at the same time, and it confused the tree a lot.

Nevertheless, looking on the bright side again, he was able to oversee all these official events too. Of course, they didn't actually walk through the flames. They would stand in front of them, barely, and use them as a nice backdrop to radiate _power_ and _strength_ to enemies and allies.



@TODO: A meeting with allies. (Some vague reference to ending the war, Companionship---what interesting ally could this be?) They clearly treat the emperor as emperor, and Gatagrip as merely his wife. But she starts the gossip about the people she wants to remove, and puts Klaudios in a tough position about refusing her or saying "calm down we'll discuss this later"
* Britain?
* The monkeys?
* The Lions? (This story _would_ be placed after The Chanceturners, right?)

Claudius ascension to the throne is also interesting ... found shivering after current emperor died, loved by army and paid them handsomely for proclaiming him emperor. Did a lot, and a lot of good, for the empire, and denied divine blessings and other dictatorial stuff. But his "infirmity" of character (being too influenced by wives and other opinions) eventually broke the Senate.

The sources all state Aggrippina murdered him---but have it revealed at the end that it was probably just malaria/fever (Febris; the God of Fever)

In the years that followed, Empero was confused. He had never seen his mother this happy. He hadn't even realized how stern and serious she was before, how she had _always_ been busy scheming or talking to him about politics. How her rare smiles had actually all been fake.

Now she would often join Empero in singing a tune. They shared the same gift of a beautiful voice, and it was said Klaudios would stroll through the garden at night and simply revel in the beautiful sounds coming from the palace.

Though Empero was perhaps growing too old for it, Gatagrip suddenly had more time to read him bedtime stories. Or play games with him. Not _every_ conversation was about power and thrones anymore.

As Empero met his tutor more often, this _confusion_ slowly made place for _understanding_.

@TODO: Sinnika instructs Empero to be _calm_, to think, to be wise and a philosopher, to not act rashly. They tell him about "fire and light" (him and his mother), and represent the Light aspect a lot. Maybe Sinnika actually meets with Tresmo and talks with them still?

@TODO: Sinnika reveals the extra things Gatagrip gets done? => Reveals he was exiled by Klaudios, but Gatagrip actually urged and convinced him to get him back, as he was deemed the best tutor to Nero?

@TODO: End with the same allies visiting again, but they now bow to Klaudios and Gatagrip equally. This causes Klaudios to be resentful and switch tactics---next chapter he is gone.
=> REMEMBER: Klaudios still has a son (Britannicus) from that previous marriage, which is the one he'd rather see on the throne now.

@TODO: Mostly hammer on the perspective of the Tree, seeing this _again and again and again_, the cycle of betrayal and killing for power just never ends.

### Outline

* Ch3 (Partner in the Empire): Agrippina whispers at Klaudios to accuse a competitor of Black Magic and get her out. She accuses Silanus of incest to break off an engagement and open the same wife (Octavia) for her son Empero. Gatagrip gets a honorific title (Augusta), Klaudios names a colony after her, statues of her were erected, people used the same customs around her (such as bowing) as they did the emperor, she became the "partner of the empire" => Gatagrip actually doesn't kill Klaudios for a long time, because she enjoys reaching (almost) equal rights and likes her life? This is a small wrinkle to the story that might be interesting?
	* Until ... Klaudios admits regretting marrying her and starts preparing another candidate for the throne instead => And now Gatagrip moves quickly again.
	* SOURCE: Ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on 13 October AD 54 with a plate of [deadly mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_poisoning "Mushroom poisoning") at a banquet, thus enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident, and according to more modern sources, it is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, being 63 years old. In the aftermath of Claudius's death, Agrippina, who initially kept the death secret, tried to consolidate power by immediately ordering that the palace and the capital be sealed. After all the gates were blockaded and exit of the capital forbidden, she introduced Nero first to the soldiers and then to the senators as emperor.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger#cite_note-yyroia-1)
* Ch4 (Tutor of Toxotes): Nero passes some good laws, is tutored by Sinnika, is liked by the common folk. Some warnings about flammability of Amor, the Toxotes fire brigade that he refuses to subsidize (or something; also mention Crassus' fire police thing?).
* Ch5: Discontent among the elite, but nothing major yet. Seneca and Agrippina had Nero under tight control---which Nero started to dislike, so he has his mother killed. (MIDPOINT)
* Ch6: Tides turned around Nero's approval. Great Fire breaks out when he's away.
* Ch7: He works really hard to save everyone, but also builds a huge temple for himself on the ashes. The elite start the rumor---helped by Tattlerat---that NERO did it. This causes a secret betrayal/assassination attempt, which is foiled.
* Ch8: Nero doubles guard and seeks another scapegoat: the Christians. He unleashes terror and mayhem on the people of Amor (which also kills Seneca).
* Ch9: The senate has a long debate, weighs the facts, then declares Nero public enemy (which means he may be killed by anyone, no questions asked). Nero flees in fear, commits suicide.
* Ch10: We jump _forward_ in time now (because the tree is still standing where it stands!) Rome is without a leader. Power vacuum---the elite that ousted Nero based on _lies_, it is revealed now, all make a play for that throne and we get some facts about how that played out.

The trick here is that we get two types of scenes. Those near the tree---which are a hundred percent _true_, for the tree witnessed them. And scenes in random other places with the elite---which are _tainted/subjective_. The only reason the tree knows them, is because they wrote their account on magical papyrus _made from that tree (Tresmo)_.










@NOTE: Remember that they are cursed with leaky buckets---or, well, EVERY container leaks water for them. The elephants have since died, and because there hadn't been any serious fires anymore, nobody took it seriously and the firefighting practice died out again. Only Augustus brought it back after a chameleon kept yapping about it.



@IDEA (STORY): The "transactional gods". The world has a bunch of gods with well-defined powers and stuff, like the Greek gods. They don't care about the world, nor are they especially selfish. They simply establish rules like "for paying X, you can buy power Y". 
* For example: "we'll murder your neighbor if you build a temple with statues of us" 
* This way, people know they can always go there and get what they want if they pay the price. 
* A very interesting take on gods and powers, which might be in Saga of Life (but it'd be _demigods_ doing this), or a different story.

SOME NOTES ON FIRES:
* Firebreaks were one of the oldest methods: simply pull down all housing/burnable material around the fire before it gets there. => This can be mentioned in Flickerless Flame, or do they only learn that here?
* Firefighting fell into disarray in the middle ages. Especially as religion said that it was simply a "divine judgment" or "god's curse" when your house burned down.
* Augustus started with the "vigiles" (slaves, both police and firefighting). Though around 250 BC the invention of a high-pressure pump made this possible at all => attribute this to Toxotes?
* When Great Fire of London broke out, all immigrants (from countries with whom they were at war) were basically blamed. Causing them to not only fear fire, but most of all fear violence from their neighbors just based on those rumors.
	* This was worsened by the mayor being indecisive, not allowing firebreaks until it was basically too late.
* During Great Fire of Rome, the vigiles mostly just looted and abused the situation.
* Afterwards, some regulations by Nero were: "Laws that called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall."
	* In general, great fires lead to actual fire/building code laws, and actually taking that seriously.

THIS RESEARCH WOULD DO WELL IN HOPPING HOMES. Building a story around a major fire, the consequences, losing homes, fire hazard in general => yes, I already planned that story with public services anyway, include this there!
