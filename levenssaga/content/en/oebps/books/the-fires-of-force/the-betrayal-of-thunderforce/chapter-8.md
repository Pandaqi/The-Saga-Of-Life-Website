@TODO








OUTLINE CH6 (Turning Tides / Tutor of Toxotes):
* Nero more research and experiments, more warnings about fire issues and stuff but he doesn't listen. 
	* This is really our final chance to really set up the scientific, theoretic backbone of it. The REALIZATION ALL HEAT EMITS LIGHT? => Also at the end "Or maybe, wherever there's fire, there will be light too. If history was always going to repeat itself, Tresmo thought, then let this be how it is."
	* And he think she figured it out, and wants to revive Alix, so he does that experiment now?
		* Nero is like "Sinnika will write about me! This is what gets my name in the history books, for now and forever!"
* Nero trying again and killing her for good now.
* Tides turned around Nero's approval. 

OUTLINE CH7+CH8 (The Great Fire + A Little Birdie Sung):
* He works really hard to save everyone+passes improved laws, but also builds a huge temple for himself on the ashes. The elite start the rumor---helped by Tattlerat---that NERO did it. This causes a secret betrayal/assassination attempt, which is foiled.

@IDEA: Use the "whispering" (by Sinnika + Gatagrip) to explain the "yanking electrons back to create waves" part? Empero would try stuff, Sinnika would yank him back. Empero would want to go _there_, Gatagrip would yank him back.

OUTLINE CH9 (The Living Torches):
* Nero doubles guard and seeks another scapegoat: the Christians. He unleashes terror and mayhem on the people of Amor (which also kills Seneca).
* Death of Sinnika is a MAJOR CLIMAX THING.
* Turning people into HUMAN TORCHES, as he finally realizes the secret of light and energy, is a MAJOR CLIMAX THING.
* Neros banishment is a MAJOR CLIMAX THING.

OUTLINE CH10 (Epilogue):
* The Senate has a long debate, weighs the facts, then declares Nero public enemy (which means he may be killed by anyone, no questions asked). Nero flees in fear, commits suicide.
* We jump _forward_ in time now (because the tree is still standing where it stands!) Rome is without a leader. Power vacuum---the elite that ousted Nero based on _lies_, it is revealed now, all make a play for that throne and we get some facts about how that played out.
* "And so, in the end, was Empero a good emperor? Was the saga of Gatagrip and Empero one that was _positive_ for Amor, or _negative_? Or was one half of it positive, and one half negative, leading to a neutral emperor?" => something like this to get back to the theme again




@TODO: Maybe Sinnika actually meets with Tresmo and talks with them still?

@TODO: Mostly hammer on the perspective of the Tree, seeing this _again and again and again_, the cycle of betrayal and killing for power just never ends.



Claudius' ascension to the throne is also interesting ... found shivering after current emperor died, loved by army and paid them handsomely for proclaiming him emperor. Did a lot, and a lot of good, for the empire, and denied divine blessings and other dictatorial stuff. But his "infirmity" of character (being too influenced by wives and other opinions) eventually broke the Senate.

The sources all state Aggrippina murdered him---but have it revealed at the end that it was probably just malaria/fever (Febris; the God of Fever)




### Outline


The trick here is that we get two types of scenes. Those near the tree---which are a hundred percent _true_, for the tree witnessed them. And scenes in random other places with the elite---which are _tainted/subjective_. The only reason the tree knows them, is because they wrote their account on magical papyrus _made from that tree (Tresmo)_.










@NOTE: Remember that they are cursed with leaky buckets---or, well, EVERY container leaks water for them. The elephants have since died, and because there hadn't been any serious fires anymore, nobody took it seriously and the firefighting practice died out again. Only Augustus brought it back after a chameleon kept yapping about it.



@IDEA (STORY): The "transactional gods". The world has a bunch of gods with well-defined powers and stuff, like the Greek gods. They don't care about the world, nor are they especially selfish. They simply establish rules like "for paying X, you can buy power Y". 
* For example: "we'll murder your neighbor if you build a temple with statues of us" 
* This way, people know they can always go there and get what they want if they pay the price. 
* A very interesting take on gods and powers, which might be in Saga of Life (but it'd be _demigods_ doing this), or a different story.

SOME NOTES ON FIRES:
* Firebreaks were one of the oldest methods: simply pull down all housing/burnable material around the fire before it gets there. => This can be mentioned in Flickerless Flame, or do they only learn that here?
* Firefighting fell into disarray in the middle ages. Especially as religion said that it was simply a "divine judgment" or "god's curse" when your house burned down.
* Augustus started with the "vigiles" (slaves, both police and firefighting). Though around 250 BC the invention of a high-pressure pump made this possible at all => attribute this to Toxotes?
* When Great Fire of London broke out, all immigrants (from countries with whom they were at war) were basically blamed. Causing them to not only fear fire, but most of all fear violence from their neighbors just based on those rumors.
	* This was worsened by the mayor being indecisive, not allowing firebreaks until it was basically too late.
* During Great Fire of Rome, the vigiles mostly just looted and abused the situation.
* Afterwards, some regulations by Nero were: "Laws that called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall."
	* In general, great fires lead to actual fire/building code laws, and actually taking that seriously.

THIS RESEARCH WOULD DO WELL IN HOPPING HOMES. Building a story around a major fire, the consequences, losing homes, fire hazard in general => yes, I already planned that story with public services anyway, include this there!




## Revision
**Ch1:** Also mention Crassus' fire police thing? Feels like that should be mentioned in chapter 1 though, when Augostos is mentioned, because _he_ created the Vigiles.
* @IDEA: Briefly use/show Crassus' corrupt firemen, and the "insurance seal" on homes, here??

**Ch2-3?**: State somewhere that "They say Gatagrip once visited a seer on the island, who told her: _Your son will be emperor and he will be your death_. And she responded: _Let him kill me, as long as he becomes emperor._"

**Ch4-5:** Around this time, Gatagrip has Britannicus (Kladios' other son) killed too. Mention that? How to involve that storyline too?

**Ch5:** Probably streamline and make the Jurads the Krystians anyway, as they'll be persecuted later + I can set up they're disliked anyway.

**Ch6 (probably):** State that they obviously use Roman Numerals at this point, which don't have 0 or negative numbers. But that our narrator "translates" for our convenience.

@TODO: Chapter 6, make Empero _responsible_ for setting Amor on fire. (Device explodes, emits thunder again but horizontally, whatever.) Make him laugh maniacally, descriptions of a mad scientist, etcetera => at the end, reveal/hint that this was all just speculation to make Nero look bad, as Tresmo did not see this first-hand.
* This also makes it more likely that he'd be singing from his favorite tower or whatever

**Somewhere (not verbatim, something like this):** mention that they obviously didn't have electricity yet, or anything close. Of course, the Ancient Turtles were gifted Elektro by the gods, but that gift had been taken away just as swiftly when they became too powerful and turned against them in the First Conflict. Two companions---a turtle and a tortoise---were making sure the secret underwater city stayed secret.

**General:** I should probably give a more CONCRETE example of the Commonfolk love/Elite hate for him. And how, after he kills his own mother, this falls away/is twisted into something clearly worse. (Show don't tell.)
