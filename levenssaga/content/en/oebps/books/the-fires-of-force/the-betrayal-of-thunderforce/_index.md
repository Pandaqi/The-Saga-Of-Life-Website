A tree watches events unfold, 

A tree cannot intervene

A beloved leader is assassinated, or so it was told

A mad woman grabs power from the chaos in-between

&nbsp;

When someone hands you a throne and a powerful name,

How can you keep your riches small and say no?

He means well, they write later, but was a monster clutching fame,

Behold the story of the betrayal, behold public enemy _Nero_
