@NOTE: Remember that they are cursed with leaky buckets---or, well, EVERY container leaks water for them. The elephants have since died, and because there hadn't been any serious fires anymore, nobody took it seriously and the firefighting practice died out again. Only Augustus brought it back after a chameleon kept yapping about it.



@IDEA (STORY): The "transactional gods". The world has a bunch of gods with well-defined powers and stuff, like the Greek gods. They don't care about the world, nor are they especially selfish. They simply establish rules like "for paying X, you can buy power Y". 
* For example: "we'll murder your neighbor if you build a temple with statues of us" 
* This way, people know they can always go there and get what they want if they pay the price. 
* A very interesting take on gods and powers, which might be in Saga of Life (but it'd be _demigods_ doing this), or a different story.

SOME NOTES ON FIRES:
* Firebreaks were one of the oldest methods: simply pull down all housing/burnable material around the fire before it gets there. => This can be mentioned in Flickerless Flame, or do they only learn that here?
* Firefighting fell into disarray in the middle ages. Especially as religion said that it was simply a "divine judgment" or "god's curse" when your house burned down.
* Augustus started with the "vigiles" (slaves, both police and firefighting). Though around 250 BC the invention of a high-pressure pump made this possible at all => attribute this to Toxotes?
* When Great Fire of London broke out, all immigrants (from countries with whom they were at war) were basically blamed. Causing them to not only fear fire, but most of all fear violence from their neighbors just based on those rumors.
	* This was worsened by the mayor being indecisive, not allowing firebreaks until it was basically too late.
* During Great Fire of Rome, the vigiles mostly just looted and abused the situation.
* Afterwards, some regulations by Nero were: "These laws called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall."
	* In general, great fires lead to actual fire/building code laws, and actually taking that seriously.

THIS RESEARCH WOULD DO WELL IN HOPPING HOMES. Building a story around a major fire, the consequences, losing homes, fire hazard in general => yes, I already planned that story with public services anyway, include this there!
