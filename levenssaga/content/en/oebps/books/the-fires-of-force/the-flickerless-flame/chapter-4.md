Dilova's restaurant had moved again. Tresmo was a distant landmark now, which she disliked. He could've helped find the sorcerer faster---and he'd sacrificed something for them. It took Prebuha a long negotiation to make the Chiefclouds rain on purpose, extinguishing the small fires. 

But in exchange, as part of the trade, Tresmo had to promise he would _never_ grow even taller than he was now. Otherwise, in their words, he'd "enter obvious cloud territory" and that was "as unnatural as when birds entered obvious cloud territory", giving Dilova a side eye.

She couldn't longingly look at Tresmo for long, though, as an entire _caravan_ of customers had arrived to enjoy her food services.






OUTLINE:
* H4: Some bit about that food is _easier_ to eat, while giving _more_ energy in Dilova's restaurant. => Maybe there are customers from REALLY FAR AWAY, who come DESPITE the fires, because of that fact? How else to show it in a fun way?
	* Dilova herself has MOVED again, following the fires, which is how she gets further away from Tresmo and sees what's happening?
	* YES, because there are MANY customers, this is EXTRA DANGEROUS. (The forest is busier, more chaos, more animals to save.)
	* Show Fiante having a bad day again.
	* More direct clash between Tresmo and Clouds? Talk about giving his seeds, while assuring everyone "we'll be fine, we'll make it" 
		* => Tresmo should be built up to be really kind and merciful and all, so the sacrifice at end makes more sense.
		* (Maybe involve clouds to help make it rain and put out a fire. => They ask it, but they're like "what's in it for me?", abusing that power.)
* H5 (Demigod Design): Discovery that Permiox is able to fix states forever (their understanding of his powers was far weaker at first, and assuming he wasn't consistent/controlled) => since then, Alix and Feria talk several times about "staying as we are right now, forever"
	* Have Mamatos return at Prebuha storyline too? Really focus on her idea of "negotiations for everything", while feeling things will never get better for her than they are now.
* H6 (Spark of Innovation): They actually manage to push the fire back, control some of it, they seem to be winning ...
* H6: Alix desperately tries to make tools in the dark (which is now confirmed to be because of the huge tree covering the entire area), which is how he notices the sparks coming off of the stone => which eventually leads to being able to _create_ fire themselves.
	* ... but then Alix creates new fire as an experiment and ruins it all again!
	* So, this next time the fires suddenly light up, they notice that NEW animals have entered the forest: wolves and jaguars, remainders of the Jagu tribe from long ago.
		* Reinforce that animals firstly flee away from fire/heat/thunder, but then predators quickly come back to prey on the fallen.
		* "WHY WOULD YOU WALK INTO FIRE VOLUNTARILY!?" => as in, this is not a dispute for space, territory, food resources, whatever, this is just them thinking they need to exact vengeance for something from long long ago.
		* "Isn't that what your fox husband has been doing for years now?"
	* (As in, for the longest time, they stumbled through the dark and thought they were alone/had saved everyone.)
	* They are STILL angry about that thing long long ago.
	* Conversation Prebuha and Feria, over warring city-states, garden of eden, etcetera.
		* "Well that's the problem isn't it? _You_ decide. Not the animals that are burning. Not the animals that lived in these woods, claimed these woods, battled rainstorms by the Chiefclouds, long before you even knew we had a sentient tree."
* H7 (Firebirds Flutter): Alix tries to _explain_ what he knows about heat to have all other animals help with extinguishing/controlling it. Add the Enyrgias again, and he can see them and explain visually like that.
	* Also have loads of firebirds come down and fly around the fires.
	* Might explain it this way: their wings flap REALLY QUICKLY. So quickly that they give off loads of _heat_. But to most eyes, the wings don't actually seem to move, because when your eye "refreshes" it's back in the same position again => that's how the tiny particles can all move rapidly, but the object just seems the same (only hotter) to you.
* H8 (Flames Licking Heels): Fleeing for the fire, hoping they can save Tresmo. Many discussions about "should I fix my situation now?"
* H9 (Demigod Dilemma): Same as H8. All _characters_ make their decision about freezing here, partially in a panic because they think the fire will kill them and they won't make it. 
	* And only Alix actually goes through with it, because he does NOT understand the balance and always just wants better, bigger, more, advance, etcetera.
	* Feria could only be angry at herself. Alix had always done this. He'd always pursued knowledge and science above all else. Of course he had made this decision, and of course it seemed perfectly logical to him and he hadn't needed to communicate it. (BREAK) Feria would leave him at once and never forgive him again, if only the magic didn't forbid her from doing so. She was stuck in a cage of love and forgiveness, and couldn't be more angry about it.
	* POTENTIALLY have one of the enemies (Jagu? Cloud?) choose to and be punished for it, such as the rotating flaming wheel punishment! Yes!
* H10 (Epilogue): Ends with the decision to freeze the _fire_, keeping it burning forever just before it reaches Tresmo.
	* This story is really about the precarious _balance_ of life. You can use most things for good, but also for bad. Many moments in your life will be great (you want to "save them/keep it that way forever"), many will be bad. Fire can enhance food supply, or burn you to death.








=> Firebirds were named that way because they always appeared near fires. This started the obvious rumor that they _caused_ it somehow, which they vehemently denied, and which had no proof at all to support it. Dilova saw it was the other way around. _She_ appeared near fires too all the time, because she needed them for her restaurant. But did she _cause_ them? Of course not. Like all animals, she had no clue how they worked, or how to contain them, and was more than happy to see them automatically extinguish again. => **@TODO: Should I rewrite this bit to SHOW this accusation+wrong line of thinking in dialogue?**



MORE GENERALLY, FIREBIRDS ALWAYS APPEAR NEAR _HEAT_.

* @IDEA: The very first "living cloud" (Chiefcloud/Smallcloud) was born from a _huge_ forest fire/steam/volcano eruption that killed so many that their souls merged into a new one; a living cloud?
* Their energy for living and such comes from the endless thermal energy created inside the cloud from sunrays?
* @IDEA: Use the entire stuff below about "Garden of Eden" here. Prebuha and Feria meet, where Prebuha tells this myth to her (or she overhears it being told to her children or something), which inspires Feria to create her Legendary Gardens as the place that will always have life force and "garden of gods".






Here are three opening chapters and what they mean. These must probably be the first 3 chapters, unless we want to combine two of them into one chapter.
* _
	* "Animals run away initially but predators and scavengers return quickly to eat the dead and dying. Early humans probably did the same at first"
	* Humans probably started by _capturing_ natural fire and learning how to keep it alive. It's also a by-product of making stone tools, as hitting flintstone against each other produces sparks and, if used enough force, _heat_. => Especially in cold and low-light environments, such as the Forest of the Fallen, which is entirely kept in darkness by its (friendly) Gigant.
	* This story is about FRICTION too, I guess?
	* THEY HAVE A CHILD (hence the "rotation for catching fire"). The SPECIAL POWER of that demigod is then REVEALED to be the "fixing state of animals magic".
	* ALIX IS SO HAPPY WITH FERIA that he eventually figures out a way to make your current (local) state "permanent".
		* "But what if tomorrow we love each other even more?"




* (She is near an area with very regular fires or lava eruptions, and she just throws stuff in the fire and takes it out to cook it. Because she's a bird and loves moving around + taking to the skies, her restaurant moves too, and she follows the fires that follow the wind? Or are there some kind of FIREBIRDS involved in this? FIREFLIES? => An early setup to Dragons?)
