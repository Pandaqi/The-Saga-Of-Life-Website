Before he started his explanation, Alix and Feria exchanged glances. They whispered their love for each other. Alix asked again if they shouldn't _freeze_ this situation, this love, this excitement and adventure, this ... this ... _being alive_. Feria responded in the same way: "but what if, tomorrow, we'd feel even more alive?"

Alix sighed and addressed the beings below.

"You all know that everything is made out of tiny little things, right?"

"No?"

"That doesn't even make sense?"

"Well, okay, just trust me on this. You can't see those tiny things, only the whole thing. But my experiments prove it must be so."

"And to kill the fire, we must kill the little things?" asked the deer.

"In a way," said Alix, annoyed at being interrupted. "Those little things can _move_. They can _vibrate_. While keeping their connections, while staying the thing they are. And the faster they vibrate, the hotter the object."

A lot of head-scratching. Alix had to move to a different lectern, as everyone walked away to flee the fires.

"Please get to the point, love."

"Consider the firebirds," said Alix after a pause.






Might explain it this way: Firebird wings flap REALLY QUICKLY. So quickly that they give off loads of _heat_. But to most eyes, the wings don't actually seem to move, because when your eye "refreshes" it's back in the same position again => that's how the tiny particles can all move rapidly, but the object just seems the same (only hotter) to you.

MORE GENERALLY, FIREBIRDS ALWAYS APPEAR NEAR _HEAT_ => because it simply makes living easier and processes faster? => AS IN, they draw ENERGY from the heat of the fires

Still make a point about how this causes the "wrong way around" thinking?
=> Firebirds were named that way because they always appeared near fires. This started the obvious rumor that they _caused_ it somehow, which they vehemently denied, and which had no proof at all to support it. Dilova saw it was the other way around. _She_ appeared near fires too all the time, because she needed them for her restaurant. But did she _cause_ them? Of course not. Like all animals, she had no clue how they worked, or how to contain them, and was more than happy to see them automatically extinguish again. => **@TODO: Should I rewrite this bit to SHOW this accusation+wrong line of thinking in dialogue?**
=> Early setup for DRAGONS?


Alix tries to _explain_ what he knows about heat to have all other animals help with extinguishing/controlling it. Add the Enyrgias again, and he can see them and explain visually like that.

Confirm here WHY warm/cooked food is _easier_ to eat, while giving _more_ energy in Dilova's restaurant.

@IDEA: A few tools have melted/soldered together because of short contact with heat

@IDEA: Have the "broken" twin sister make a brief appearance? Or maybe just a vague reference: "only one firebird body lay in the ashes, crumpled and broken, as if it was put there on purpose by a Chiefcloud."

ENDING: The fire has reached the general area around Tresmo. The Jagu tribe has lost some members, but enough of them have returned and focus on Prebuha and her people, or Alix for creating that new fire.






OUTLINE:
* H9 (Of Demigod Dilemma): Same as H8. All _characters_ make their decision about freezing here, partially in a panic because they think the fire will kill them and they won't make it. 
	* And only Alix actually goes through with it, because he does NOT understand the balance and always just wants better, bigger, more, advance, etcetera.
		* Alix is starting to SHUT DOWN again because he hasn't been able to eat enough food the past few days?
	* Feria could only be angry at herself. Alix had always done this. He'd always pursued knowledge and science above all else. Of course he had made this decision, and of course it seemed perfectly logical to him and he hadn't needed to communicate it. (BREAK) Feria would leave him at once and never forgive him again, if only the magic didn't forbid her from doing so. She was stuck in a cage of love and forgiveness, and couldn't be more angry about it. Nothing was going to change his inner world, or hers.
	* POTENTIALLY have one of the enemies (Jagu? Cloud?) choose to and be punished for it, such as the rotating flaming wheel punishment! Yes! => **Ixion (Hell Punishment)** (?) => bound to a (flaming) wheel that never stops spinning.
* H10 (Epilogue): Ends with the decision to freeze the _fire_, keeping it burning forever just before it reaches Tresmo.
	* This story is really about the precarious _balance_ of life. You can use most things for good, but also for bad. Many moments in your life will be great (you want to "save them/keep it that way forever"), many will be bad. Fire can enhance food supply, or burn you to death.
















Here are the general arcs/threads.
* The Forest of the Fallen catches on fire. They can't extinguish it, as it burns more and more, until it reaches the (first) Gigant Tresmo which _can't flee_ but they really want to preserve.
	* I should show Tresmo being a really good being, keeping the balance, trusted by the gods (who also feel really proud that such a thing---a sentient tree---could have grown on their lands) => This tree is constantly vouching for the gods and preventing the first conflict from breaking out too early, as well as fighting against mean stuff/bullying from the Chiefclouds.
	* It eventually (in a panic) dispatches _seeds_ that grow into the four separate Gigants known from later stories?
	* "They had learned how to create and sustain fire. They had forgotten to give equal attention to extinguishing it." (Which is a GREAT setup for the NEXT story about the Toxotes fire brigade and stuff.) => YES, this must come LATER, for they can't CREATE fire yet as of right now.

Here are the endings.
* Dilova realizes she doesn't _want_ to fix the state. She will take the bad days of father; they'll make the good days worth even more.
* Prebuha gets everyone out, but breaks a bone/gets a scar in the process, which she obviously doesn't want to "fix". She realizes the moment has passed and moves on?? Or she accidentally falls asleep just before "fixing it", making her sleep _forever_? And the reader can answer the question of whether this is "bad/sad" or actually blissful themselves?
	* Maybe Prebuha can still be a bit down and nihilistic from her old experiences, tired and unsure where to go next?
	* Maybe like "It's the same everywhere. Everyone is always fighting. All these people are _one_, supportive of the gods, eating the same food, living on the same lands, and _still they attack each other_. Physical or otherwise."
	* "How else could life develop? You have to defend your place when attacked. There isn't infinite space for everyone. A continuous cycle of civil war is needed."
	* "No. Where I come from, we had peace for a thousand years, and we lived _well_. It _is possible_." She realized she'd made her decision. If she fixed her world now, that cycle of war and vengeance would indeed never end. But if she didn't, if she tried more negotiations tomorrow, she might just return Somnia to eternal peace. Before things could get even worse for the godchildren.
* But Alix still pulls the trigger, thinking he is as happy with Feria as he'll ever be. This locks the forest fire around him into place, but also locks his intelligence (for example). 
	* => The Fireforest of the Fallen burns permanently, until the end of the timeline, even inaccessible to humans?
	* That's where the title "Flickerless Flame" comes from, so I feel this _must_ be the ending.
* Tresmo, and the few plants/animals around it, are forever locked in that hell. (One of them rotating on the flaming wheel.) He isn't exactly dead, but he might as well be. Amor ends up being built around him.


**Energy Type:** Thermal (Heat) Energy
* Talk about that delay (atoms straining against other atoms) when you push something and result, equal to speed of sound through that material.
* Talk more about the smaller particles and the energy they get from their bonds anyway.
* Explain that _heat_ is just _how fast particles randomly jitter_.
* This story is about FRICTION too, I guess?


THIS WILL PROBABLY BE A SMALL SIDE STORY, it's a fun idea but nothing for the "main" stories of the Saga of Life.

* @IDEA: The very first "living cloud" (Chiefcloud/Smallcloud) was born from a _huge_ forest fire/steam/volcano eruption that killed so many that their souls merged into a new one; a living cloud?
* Their energy for living and such comes from the endless thermal energy created inside the cloud from sunrays?
