A bird with a sick father and a kitchen that moves around

A tribal sloth, and a fox, whose experiments cannot be bound

Hear of a special magic that might grant every desire

And meet in a forest that regularly sets itself on fire

&nbsp;

As they swing between selfishness, and finding the perfect day

The fires get out of control, and the history books will forever say

The first sentient tree that Somnia knew, was kind, wise and a shelter to all

But when tempting magic comes to call, the trees in the forest might forever fall
