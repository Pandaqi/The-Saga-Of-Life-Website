Ever since they landed

The Gods are held back by invisible walls

Who made them and how do they break them?

Ardex gives the attempt his all

&nbsp;

But when someone gets stuck on the other side

And withers without access to life

They must understand energy and find more of that

Or all life would turn a statue; or worse even, dead
