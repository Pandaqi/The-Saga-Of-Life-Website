OUTLINE Ch4: A two-parter. One shows gang recovery and formally introduces gods by showing the war being waged; the other shows Toxotes elephants investigating and getting closer, such as discovering HOW they did it
* Gangs near-escape and recovery.
* First secret meeting between Ardex and Ruby. (They are "discovered", or nearly so, by a fox? To get more hints towards Alix?) Ardex goes on about the "terrible criminals" causing the fires and crumbled temples and all, while Ruby has to bite her tongue and not give herself away.
	* Is this secret meeting _within_ Tremo's fire cage? As they can both cross it, while basically nobody else can?
	* ALSO remember that she brought some diamonds with her, pretending they were for aid or what not, but really they are gifts for the godchildren?
* Something something => Olfaman suddenly loses all will to help people, Ollimo cannot get them to join anymore, which saddens them and makes them stand alone (which isn't great).
(+ a very quick mention of chameleon. We've set up the pattern, so we don't need more than that, just introduce, show the thing they're PASSIONATE about now, and how it fails in a silly way. Though the chameleon needs to get more depth at some point: "Life is full of POSSIBILITY! I want to do EVERYTHING! Learn EVERYTHING! Try EVERYTHING!")


* Turns out they dug out the entire foundation and removed any load-bearing walls, then started a fire _elsewhere_ as distraction.
	* A slight hint to how they pulled off the first theft? "While Ruby sucked in the heat of the fire, Wilplink reduced the chances of burns or spreading, while Boaris and Mmhmmhmm stole the valuables. As soon as we all left, through underground tunnels, Wilplink flipped the chances and allowed it all to burn down."
	* "Now, Mmhmmhmm was a bit of a liar. He hadn't dug all those tunnels himself. Many of them were part of a secret project of the wolves, and the reason their surprise attack overwhelmed the Trusks long ago."

@TODO: At Flickerless Flame, rewrite to have it make sense that "mostly tusk-wearing characters (includes Prebuha??) settle around Tresmo and become the Trusks"?


@IDEA: Wilplink's chance magic is _not certain_, of course. It's chance. So something GOES WRONG and he's like "I told you! I told you it's _probability_, not certainty! I did my best. It just wasn't enough."

@IDEA: One of the gang wants to give up when it gets too hard, one of the gang admits they were only there for personal gain from the start? (This would be mole and boar, as the other two clearly care.)

(@IDEA for later: move Crassus' corrupt firemen, and the "insurance seal" on homes, to Nero's story?)

(REMEMBER: The fourth casualty is hidden by Ruby here, because it is Ardex, whom she greatly admires and has secret meetings with.)




The crime gang is ...
* Ruby (species = Firebird)
* Wilplink (Chance turner, species = Viverra; civet cat)
* Mmhmmhmm (species = A mole; their names all have many M's and sound like their mouth is stuffed with dirt :p)
* Boaris (demigod of Eeris?; species = That boar that arrives later, briefly recounting the chameleon experience.)


IDEA: Make that jeweler that Tamli king who miraculously survives? Fits their lifestyle, riches, and that we reveal they're a rhino later.




* Ch3-Ch4 (With A Chance of Thievery): Another crime, Toxotes continues to investigate and chase.
	* Now one of the firemen investigating is suddenly gone. Doesn't "want to do it anymore". A house somewhere else burns down because they "don't feel like helping people anymore".
	* Keep naming the Chameleon differently :p "The Chameleon-of-many-names" and "You rainbow-colored salamander" => later escapades should be more and more unlikely, such as "I will build the outer walls five times as high, to keep out most of the godchildren." or "I will bake bread every day to make sure everyone in Amor can eat" => It ends with THEM "carrying leaky buckets of water" to help douse the fires in the end? Even though it's useless, and a lot of work, they have the PASSION so they DO IT, and it actually matters?
	* HAHA at the end "Who are _you_?" The chameleon spoke with a pause between each word. "They call me ... many names."
* Ch5: Alix is revealed as being present in Amor, and he's the one stealing everyone's wishes/desire. This causes a betrayal/obstacle in the operations of the crime gang, which brings them all at odds with each other and in trouble. 
	* It had started with an attempt to steal _wisdom_ from others. To steal knowledge, brainpower, the thing that Alix feared he would never get again. It turned into stealing desires, wishes, the energy that comes from beings who _want_ to live and who _want_ to achieve greatness or simply fight for better every day.
	* After all that time, especially with Feria always gone to fight battles, missing her love like he'd never missed something before, it turned to cold-blooded wish theft.
* Ch6-Ch7: Another crime, Toxotes continues to investigate and chase.
* Ch8-Ch9: Another crime, they finally catch them and manage to imprison their leader; the rest escapes.
* Ch10: ????

"Thanks is nice, but never the goal. If you only do things because you want others to be thankful and in your debt, then you put control over your life in their hands. You'll stop doing anything when thanks does _not_ come. You die when nobody is there to see you and applaud you."
