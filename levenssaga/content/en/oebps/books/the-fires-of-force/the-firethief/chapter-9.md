* CH9:
	* @ISSUE: Now the Rescue Squad doesn't go to third storage ... while Boaris' information about that becomes useless that way => Should I rewrite to Ruby going ahead with the "most violent version of the plan" anyway, but people are waiting for her there? Something to bring it all back to fires and her secret with Ardex and where it all started?
		* The REAL issue, I guess, is that the fires aren't threatening any homes/people we know. It would make far more sense if the fires encroached Dilova's restaurant, for example. Maybe Tresmo. Maybe a consul, but they really haven't played any role in this story.
	* This scene ends when it goes wrong and the mole dies.
		* Wilplink's chance magic is _not certain_, of course. It's chance. So something GOES WRONG and he's like "I told you! I told you it's _probability_, not certainty! I did my best. It just wasn't enough."
		* "I don't want an explanation. Fix it!"
		* "I---don't---care anymore."
	* Ollimo fights the fires, but can't curb them. Until the chameleon joins with loads of buckets to carry water ... all of which are accidentally broken. Still, he is not deterred, and starts carrying _leaky buckets_ (as Ardex' story foretold) to help firefight.
	* "Who are _you_?" The chameleon spoke with a pause between each word. "I have ... many names. But I've finally chosen one. Chamtaid." (named after the Danaids)
	* Alix arrives to steal Chameleon's passion, but is caught in the fire/fighting, and eventually dies.
		* The "trap" is made by ALIX in the first place, because he thinks it might trap the chameleon too? => It's some complex thing that heavily relies on gravitational energy?
		* Could there be some dramatic irony? The thing his mother told him ("You need to die!"), is told to him again, or he says that to someone else just before perishing?
		* Just before the end, Alix is like "I have so much left to learn! So much to study! So many secrets in the universe I haven't unlocked yet@!"
		* => In the end, Alix desperately asks Permiox "Save me! Freeze my life! Don't care about the wounds!", but Permiox is too sad/tired/doubtful (and he promised never to use the magic again, of course), and all he freezes is those buckets dripping water forever!
	* The Rescue Squad escapes, but Wilplink's conviction now wavers, and Ruby is finally captured. Ruby---the one who most desires freedom and activity and doing as they please, the one who is most _similar_ to a dragon already---is captured and imprisoned in Pendulum Prison.
		* This makes their imprisonment extra sour at the end, in which Ardex (also God of Death) realizes they must simply prevent more deaths in this war. But Ardex says "Laws are Laws, Rules are Rules" and keeps her imprisoned.
		* _Nothing's gonna change my world._
* CH10:
	* With Ruby arrested, Alix dead, Amor half in ruins and without food, the gods decide to _back off_. 
	* Typical epilogue stuff (jeweler, Wilplink, Boaris, elephants, all handled)

EPILOGUE STUFF:
* The jeweler Tamli king miraculously survives? Fits their lifestyle, riches, and that we reveal they're a rhino later. => Basically sure to be arrested/die. Then Wilplink, the Chanceturner, modifies probability. So it's like "Goodness. What are the _chances_ of that?" Nobody conquers the Tamli kings.
* "Thanks and rewards are nice, but never the goal. If you only do things because you want others to be thankful and in your debt, then you put control over your life in their hands. You'll stop doing anything when thanks does _not_ come. You die when nobody is there to see you and applaud you."
	* It is BOARIS who says this to him? Or Boaris starts this/ends this, talking together with Olfaman?
	* Boaris explains a little bit about growing up alone, having to be egotistical/steal just to survive?
	* BETTER IDEA => Olfaman is able to get his passion "back" because it doesn't rely on outward factors. But then we need a COUNTERWEIGHT that cares about thanks and approval and all, who is unable to get it back? => THE RHINO JEWELER. Set them up to clearly only do work for money and riches and status. They were one of the "influential" people in Amor that way.
* De goden realiseren dat de tegenstander gewoon zoveel mogelijk doden wil, want _dat_ zal de levensenergie van de goden wegzuigen.
	* Dus ze maken ergens de lastige beslissing om NIET meer te vechten. Laat ze binnenkomen, laat ze steeds meer land pakken, zolang ze maar niemand doden en iedereen overleeft => ze steken hun _energie_ in andere dingen, zoals iedereen laten vluchten en een veilige haven creÃ«ren. => Ook al zijn de goden sterker (met hun magie), ze kiezen voor een underdog guerilla warfare tactiek.
* @IDEA: This goes so wrong that Wilplink basically tells himself "stop caring, just accept you're a criminal and do stuff for your own gain"? _That's_ the source of his cynical/weathered outlook in The Chanceturners?
	* Nah, that would make more sense if he got really upset when people called him a _criminal_ or whatever ...
* @IDEA: Have Ardex' decision about his flamefeaster come back => 
	* "Every war is a civil war. We all come from the same parents, long long ago."
	* "But if it's so long ago nobody remembers the common ancestors," said Dilova, "then you are practically a different folk, are you not?"
	* "How long is that? Give me a number." Ardex shook his head and played with his Heavenmatter, a frozen flame called the Flamefeaster, standing on XX. "We're all the same family, that's a fact. Every war is selfish and self-destructive. The only way I can still function is by forgetting things that are too long ago." => or something in that vein.




@IDEA (Type B story?): About why money came to be represented by _gold_.

* "The discovery of dollarbillium was a great blow to the molecular currenciests."


SOME NOTES ON FIRES:
* Firebreaks were one of the oldest methods: simply pull down all housing/burnable material around the fire before it gets there. => This can be mentioned in Flickerless Flame, or do they only learn that here?
* Firefighting fell into disarray in the middle ages. Especially as religion said that it was simply a "divine judgment" or "god's curse" when your house burned down.
* Augustus started with the "vigiles" (slaves, both police and firefighting). Though around 250 BC the invention of a high-pressure pump made this possible at all => attribute this to Toxotes?
* When Great Fire of London broke out, all immigrants (from countries with whom they were at war) were basically blamed. Causing them to not only fear fire, but most of all fear violence from their neighbors just based on those rumors.
	* This was worsened by the mayor being indecisive, not allowing firebreaks until it was basically too late.
* During Great Fire of Rome, the vigiles mostly just looted and abused the situation.
* Afterwards, some regulations by Nero were: "These laws called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall."
	* In general, great fires lead to actual fire/building code laws, and actually taking that seriously.

THIS RESEARCH WOULD DO WELL IN HOPPING HOMES. Building a story around a major fire, the consequences, losing homes, fire hazard in general => yes, I already planned that story with public services anyway, include this there!
