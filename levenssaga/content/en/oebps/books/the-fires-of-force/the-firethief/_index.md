When gods hurl their overwhelming forces

At enemies within and without your town

Nobody notices, nobody holds their horses

When your possessions are stolen, your home turned upside-down

&nbsp;

It takes a special power, a passion of iron resolves

To keep chasing the criminals and believe you can catch them still

But all who come close shall mysteriously lose that will

Notwithstanding success and riches, a criminal pact appears full of holes
