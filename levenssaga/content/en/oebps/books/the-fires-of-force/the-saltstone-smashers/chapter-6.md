"_Fascinating_!" Alix said again, as he picked up the twigs that the Gosti had used. Then he took the longest and thickest one and placed it underneath the large boulder. Below it, he placed a tiny rock, which acted as a tipping point: by pushing down his end of the twig, the other end would come up.

"Great," Ardex said. "You've made an uneven seesaw. I hated that thing in the Heavenly Palace."

The gods all watched Alix with distrust, prepared to laugh at him. Only Feria was confident and encouraged him.

"By studying the universe, I learned that the _force_ you need to move something, is larger if that thing has a _larger mass_. In other words, if it's heavier. That's why we can't move this heavy boulder, because none of us can produce that much force. But we can throw a stone or kick a leaf with ease, as it's light."

"So?" said Ardex.

"But what we really care about is _energy_. The energy needed to move something is equal to the _force_ times _distance_. If one end of the seesaw moves _a long distance_ we only need a little force to move it."

"I am not following," said Ardex.

"I will show you then."

He jumped on his end of the twig. It meant a drop to the ground of about twice his size. His weight provided the force, and it did so over a long distance.

The other end, because the rock was placed so close to it, only moved up by a tiny bit. 

_In the first story of this cycle, dear reader, you learned about the Conservation of Energy. The energy you put in must be the same as what you get out. Energy is never added or lost. So, to transfer the energy of Alix' jump over a shorter distance, the universe MUST create a larger force to compensate. If the same force pushed on the boulder, then energy would have been lost somewhere, because the distances are not the same._

A force so large that it nudged the boulder from its place. Not by much, of course. It only moved the boulder _a little bit_. But it was just enough to grab Darus from underneath and pull him to safety.

"I call it a _lever_," said Alix.

Feria smiled at him and mumbled: "_Magic commences at his touch._"

@TODO: Also _show_ that the Enyrgia from his pressure on his side just _transfers_ over the twig to the other side. It's still the same, but now they must all fit in a much smaller distance, which means it's a much bigger pile of _force_ in a smaller space (that all point upwards).










**Chapter 6:**
* Alix is raised to a special status. Roams around the earth to find another Giant Fox to save the species, and gets all help/tools/massive amounts of food from the gods.
	* "At some point, everyone would figure out that Alix could not defend himself. That all his food went to his brains and nothing else. And then he'd leave for a different territory, escaping a terrible death once again."
	* After traveling _everywhere_, he only finds one female Giant Fox and that's it.
	* Also, this shows the ADAPTABILITY of foxes and Gosti. Only those two species are found _everywhere_
* All seems well, until we end on the reveal that Alix plans to steal the Marker Stones for something.

**Chapter 7**:
* TIME JUMP
* We move to the perspective of a third species. One that's called/hunted/almost goes extinct just to satisfy The Alchemist. We also see their desire to create tools themselves, so I'll most likely focus on birds using stones/twigs to break stuff or reach stuff.
* (And a fourth species, such as the felines? Which are now like "well this isn't fair")

**Chapter 8**:
* We get a glimpse of Alix' friendship with the Gosti. He explains the stone breaking, which gives the Gosti stones, which makes sharpening their sticks _much faster_.
	* (They are like "Well that took us three months the first time!")
* He is secretly working against the gods with the mindset of "nobody cares about me; I care about nobody", as he studies the universe more and devises a plan to use the Marker Stones to capture sunlight.

**Chapter 9**:
* The Gosti come back with a vengeance. They have now multiplied their tools + their way of using energy to resize and become a "Smasher".
* As they do so, Alix abuses it to create his major "capture tons of energy plan"
* Feria has to upset the balance to save Alix specifically, making stuff worse for all other animals and almost trapping all gods away from Energeia connection.

**Chapter 10**:
* Alix does _not_ save his species, putting him in the weird position of possibly being the final Giant Fox there'll ever be. Feria also takes a (suspicious) liking to him.
* The first tools have been invented and are being spread to other species.
* The Smashers have been stopped by removing all their Marker Stones, though it _almost_ leads to all the gods being disconnected from Enyrgeia.
* Darus must be _really mad_ about all of this and vows to separate himself from his family. Maybe he even searches ways to get back to Father anyway? Or to help Alix, secretly, agreeing that this place stinks?



Somewhere in there, we can talk about mechanical energy and forces, to explain the use of tools and how they can amplify power.

And about the relationship between adaptability and intelligence. Both humans and foxes have the widest ranges of coverage on earth, and both are known for adaptability and intelligence, as opposed to raw power or size. (I also chose the _fox_ because it's an animal most people like and can somewhat imagine being an alchemist or a "smart/sly/cunning" person.)

(As usual, these are "protofoxes": a larger and still more cat-like version. Also have Glyptodon and Megatherium walk around and be scary.)

TOOL USE evolved because we didn't have the NATURAL TOOLS of other animals (claws, beak, tail, armor of Glyptodon, etcetera)

Our "higher intelligence" (larger brain, more brain power needed) could only be sustained if we actually made use of it to get enough food. Other beings are simply content with what they are and how little food they need; anyone that "evolves to be more intelligent" is actually at a disadvantage because they can't get enough food for that. => Is this the Alchemist's problem?

@IDEA: The "Second Conflict" time period really comes down, in the end, to multiple _homo species_ (there were about nine of them) fighting it out and _only homo sapiens surviving_ ( = us). That's the very final step in that evolution and a very logical one to happen there.
