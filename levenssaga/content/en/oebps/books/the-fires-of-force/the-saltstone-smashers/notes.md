Somewhere in there, we can talk about mechanical energy and forces, to explain the use of tools and how they can amplify power.

And about the relationship between adaptability and intelligence. Both humans and foxes have the widest ranges of coverage on earth, and both are known for adaptability and intelligence, as opposed to raw power or size. (I also chose the _fox_ because it's an animal most people like and can somewhat imagine being an alchemist or a "smart/sly/cunning" person.)

(As usual, these are "protofoxes": a larger and still more cat-like version. Also have Glyptodon and Megatherium walk around and be scary.)

Our "higher intelligence" (larger brain, more brain power needed) could only be sustained if we actually made use of it to get enough food. Other beings are simply content with what they are and how little food they need; anyone that "evolves to be more intelligent" is actually at a disadvantage because they can't get enough food for that. => Is this the Alchemist's problem?

@IDEA: The "Second Conflict" time period really comes down, in the end, to multiple _homo species_ (there were about nine of them) fighting it out and _only homo sapiens surviving_ ( = us). That's the very final step in that evolution and a very logical one to happen there.

## Revision
@TODO: Actually describe the foxes a bit more, give the unique/specific things that _set them apart_ from modern foxes.

@TODO: Be a little more clear/specific about that the Marker Stones suck out energy (to recharge themselves), _that's_ why Darus turned a statue. (Only when charged do they _give out_ the energy.) That makes the end more sensible.

@TODO: Add the phrase "Nothing's Gonna Change My World" to story 1 (of this cycle) too?

@TODO: Optional extra paragraph/bit for when Alix is traveling.
> "At some point, everyone would figure out that Alix could not defend himself. That all his food went to his brains and nothing else. And then he'd leave for a different territory, escaping a terrible death once again."
