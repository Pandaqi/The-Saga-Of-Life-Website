Unbreakable stone suddenly lies in pieces

Unthinkable acts by a mysterious species

The Saltstone Smashers rage over Origina

But nobody who knows how, or why, or even seen them

&nbsp;

The godchildren stumble upon

A fox so smart it surprises them so

But to power that brain, he needs energy in spades

And all his clever plans might see the light too late
