Alix' family was certain that a boulder the size of a hill would stop the Smashers. The defense had landed in their lap by sheer luck; a waste product of Darus, God of Stone, experimenting with his magic. They could not have moved that boulder into position in a million years, not with a million foxes. As it was, there were only four of them: Alix, his sister, and his parents.

Now the boulder perfectly closed off the den they'd dug deep into the dirt. A wall between them and everyone else. Between them and the Smashers.

How wrong they were.

Alix studied an insect crawling over the stone. The purple fox had memorized an entire list of all insects he'd seen and their behavior, just as he knew all possible types of rock and their properties. This one, he knew, was unbreakable. Not even a mammoth at full speed would make a dent.

The family shivered in the dark. Relaxed and confident, but still cold. Since the asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, all of Somnia had been plunged into an ice age. 

_As it happens, dear reader, cold temperatures lead to larger animals, such as mammoths. The disappearance of dinosaurs---large monsters that carelessly trample you underfoot---also helped. Alix was not a small fox as you know them today, but a much larger ancestor that the godchildren called Giant Foxes._

"Get away from the boulder, Alix," his mother hissed.

He didn't respond. His body couldn't move, not because it was frozen, but because it lacked the energy. All his energy was used to keep his eyes open and his brain running. Even if he wanted---and he really didn't---he would lack the willpower to reposition his paws.

Yes, this was a Silverfish insect. He'd seen them before. He admired them. Efficient they were, their gray bodies hard to see against the gray---

The boulder shook. 

Alix rolled backward and hit the wall hard.

The boulder shook again. Dust fell on his head. Chipped stones and clanking pebbles rained into the den. 

"They can't get through," his father said confidently. 

"Alix, Firaxa, come here, let me hold you," his mother said. 

His sister cuddled up to mother and enjoyed her warmth. Alix still poured his energy into his brains, not his limbs. He lay against the wall, crumpled, and stared at the ceiling---at the beginnings of a crack in the boulder.

The crack deepened, widened, shot over the surface like a snake chased by fire. The boulder groaned, but held firm.

"Alix!" mother hissed, her voice wavering.

Father started digging a second exit for the den. They always did that, but now they had lacked the time. The Saltstone Smashers could move faster than any feline, break objects thought unbreakable. The fox family only noticed their presence in time because Alix had _calculated_ they'd come here.

"Let him do his thing," father groaned. He gave his son a weak smile. "He'll save us in the end. Trust him. Trust his intellect."

Mother and sister dug too, accelerating the process. "Or he'll doom us all! He's like a statue!"

Alix tried to think. He was _certain_ they couldn't break the boulder. The force it would take ... no animal could produce that. Even gods would struggle, he imagined. They barely understood _forces_ themselves.

Alix had studied the universe until his eyes were too tired to see; still the universe had its surprises. It's why he kept doing it.

A loud _thud_ and a _crack_.

The den shook. The boulder shifted. Alix' nostrils were clogged by dirt, his paw locked beneath a chipped-off rock.

One crack became two, became four, became no cracks at all. Because the boulder was gone.

A handful of cut rocks flowed into the den and threatened to crush Alix. His energy had run out, to the point he closed his eyes and lay still.

He heard a _swoosh_, and another one. His mother cried out. In the darkness, nails clashed with nails, teeth bit into fur, and his father bellowed with rage at the attackers.

Paws danced around him, flattening the earth or and pushing the rocks deeper into it. Some were lifted with immense effort and thrown at the attacker. They rarely hit. The Smashers moved too quickly and were impossible to spot in the darkness underground. Instead, the rocks clanged off of walls, sending ghostly echoes into Alix' ears, until one of them hit him in the head.

He had no further memory of that night.

When he woke up, he lay on a warm back. The gait of his carrier jostled him left and right, until they stopped by a tree and he slid off.

Warm breath blew into his face. It seemed to invigorate him, unfreezing him with a bit of energy.

His mother stared into his eyes.

"Your father ... your sister ..." 

Mother's eyes were glassy, on the verge of dropping tears, but foxes were unable to cry in that way. Instead, she looked away and loudly howled at the moon, until Alix felt deafened.

"Your fault," mother hissed. "Unbreakable, was it?"

"New information has come to---"

"Don't talk like that!"

"Like what?"

"Like you're ... you're ... smarter than all of us!" Mother nudged him further into the forest with her snout. As if she still tried to hide him from the Smashers. "You are _not_. You are _weak_. You can't even lift a paw, and your teeth would not even hurt an insect!"

Mother pushed him further and further, howling and crying after every effort. She had killed a squirrel and ate some of it to regain strength. Alix reached out to do the same, his body _begging_ for food, but mother pushed him aside.

"And all this time, your diet is that of a dinosaur," she said. "For years, you've eaten ten times as much as father. And it ruined us."

His sister. His father. The Smashers had taken them when they should not have. He'd done all the calculations! They had to be small creatures. A Giant Fox had to beat them easily.

"I need to experiment further on---"

"_You_," hissed mother. She gave him a final shove that sent him rolling off a cliff. "_Need to die._"

His final energy was wasted on confusion. On his mother's furious face, on finding out where he was, on deciphering why she would kill her own son.

He had studied the universe; he had not studied his own species nearly enough.

It seemed he was about to study the Dolphin Pass from below the waves.
