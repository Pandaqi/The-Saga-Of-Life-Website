## 1. The detour to Nibuwe
Escape rocket with Hera, Casjara and Simmo arrives---after much bad luck and detours---at Nibuwe. Hera reads and uses many old idioms. Casjara always active, athletic, a bit aggressive. Simmo runs from everything.

The landing is rough. Space regulators check the surroundings, come back very quickly. They're happy and establish their new colony here.

No life to be seen. Purple, stony, flat ground. Days here last three days. There is some kind of plant that looks like grass.

Casjara comes back: two dead people found. She's going to build an army against the danger.

## 2. The space spirits
The captain calls everyone together. Many people have died in the meantime and he says it was from weapons. Reveals there are still weapons aboard.

Accuses Casjara, who by now has a small army. Casjara turns out to be the daughter of military advisor ApraniÃ«, thinks her father a coward, and believes she deserves better.

Hera pulls in Simmo. He wants to flee and gets several people to go with him.

She stays with Casjara who goes on an expedition, looking for the danger. They find it unexpectedly and have to retreat.

## 3. The lonely tree
Simmo and group find a tree---the only one on this planet.

They speculate about the unique kinds of life that could have evolved here. Things completely unlike anything they know.

He hears screaming from the camp and flees in the opposite direction.

Hera and Casjara flee further, but don't want to lead the creatures to the camp, even though they can't see what's following them. From a distance they see the beings are intelligent and still coming for the camp.

Hera realizes the animals here must be adapted to this life. Recalls the Gosti, the ghost animals you could never spot.

That's how Casjara finds the beasts and forces them from their hiding place. They're larger, purple, extra strong variants of animals they know. Poisonous snakes bite her arm.

Hera stops the fight and they find they can---sort of---communicate with the beings.

## 4. The upside down world
Simmo and group find the animals' nest. It seems deserted. It's a kind of forest, but without trees and with very different plants.

They walk inside, but Simmo's instinct to flee saves them. The creatures return (or awaken) and Simmo pulls his group away.

Once back at the tree they realize they're getting nowhere this way. Simmo sees the tree upside down and realizes: this is a (flipped) crashed rocket.

Hera (and a few others) are allowed to go with the animals to speak with them.

They explain that new creatures kept arriving, always from that blasted Somnia. They can no longer pronounce certain letters. They arrived here _before_ the Babbling Brothers made all animals speak different languages. And they mention someone named "Idi" who is important.

## 5. The theft
Casjara uses Simmo's rocket plans to secretly damage parts of the rocket. That way she can sneak in, break in, and empty the weapons hold.

(Simmo's group walks by, but they're following some kind of trail.)

Hera talks with the panda. Says they coexist in order to keep the system in balance. Danger and having to survive make you strong. But humans? They've transcended nature and are too dangerous.

Casjara comes by, says she's sorry and would also like to chat. Hera and the animals are nearly ready to allow it, until Hera spots Casjara secretly carrying weapons.

She pretends the animals are extremely dangerous, tells Casjara not to attack, and runs back.

The panda has had enough. That "Idi" will have to determine their fate now.

## 6. The outcast river
Simmo (and group) break the tree apart. Hear footsteps, rabbits and hares come and seem to pray to the tree. Furious their "lonely tree" has been destroyed. They too speak of "Idi" who they will fetch.

They walk in a completely different direction. Follow a river of gasoline leaking from the rocket.

They come upon a _different_ nest. Another group. When he sees the whistling hares and koalas together, he realizes: this was the drawing on the rocket, that rocket belonged to Mindy! (But if she crashed, she surely won't be alive anymore.)

The rabbits can communicate better with the humans, explain that only Kurijn's descendants survived the Babbling Brothers.

And then Simmo realizes that Idi is "Mindy".

## 7. The astronaut Idi
Simmo back in the camp. A deserted chaos with frightened people around a fire.

Walks in on an argument between Hera and Casjara. It's over between them. Hera wants nothing more to do with it, Casjara angrily storms off (with weapons visible).

But he doesn't flee, he goes there and goes with Hera to look for Mindy.

Our all-knowing narrator reveals lending a hand and making Mindy easy to find.

Mindy tells of the arduous human journey into space. How she's done with all the fighting and colonization, and can't help with anything. How she brought together Prince and Pika (whistling hares) but couldn't do more and has been lonely all this time.

Simmo and Hera realize what they truly want. To stay, build a life, not venture farther into space. Mindy says they may stay then.

The panda storms in that the nest has been attacked---with weapons.

## 8. The battle for Platsu
Casjara attacks the nest. Partly tactical, partly she's weakened and emotional (partly because of Hera).

They shoot wildly, nature uses every trick it has (thick hide to stop bullets, entangling plants, powders flowers spray into the air)

Until the nest wins and gets Casjara on the ground, disoriented.

By the time Mindy reaches the nest, it's deserted. She feels guilty. Realizes now she should have been much stricter, sent the humans away immediately.

Then they discover the fight has only _moved_ to the Stone of Plasu. Animals on one side, Casjara on the other, Simmo's group in the middle taking apart the Lonely Tree Rocket. Then Jacintah appears.

## 9. The wrong shot
Jacintah uses her powers to take away all weapons and teleport them far from any danger.

Jacintah explains this is _her_ planet. For years she's been bringing animals here when they near extinction on Somnia. (That's why it's called Plasu, from _plaatsvouwer_ meaning folder/teleporter.)

Hera makes one last attempt to get Casjara back, to calm her, to find a future without violence.

Casjara refuses. She pulls Hera with her and walks to the Lonely Tree Rocket. She takes out a hidden handgun and forces Simmo's group to pour in the fuel and clear the way.

Hera realizes she's lost Casjara for good. She struggles free. The panda doesn't want to let Casjara get away. In their final attack they panic Casjara, she loses her balance, and she shoots Mindy down.

She flees in the rocket, with difficulty. The rest care for Mindy and give her a funeral.

## 10. Epilogue
They dismantle the rocket (and weapons) and use it to build a small, clean colony for the humans on this planet.

Strict rules are established between the humans and animals. Especially that they may not build any space stations and nothing more can land here: the Radio Silence of Plasu.

Simmo has to burn all his drawings; but Hera saves one. He realizes he's good at being an astronaut but doesn't want to be, so he studies the life here instead.

Jacintah explains how rare life is. That she hasn't found anything else in this infinite universe. But something else must have existed, because the gods used to do odd jobs around the universe for their father.

Hera now reads alone, in her armchair. Casjara has founded CAJAR, a large criminal organization. The world reacts shocked to Mindy's murder, Trevran doesn't react at all.

Hera is too angry and feels too betrayed. She takes out Simmo's diagrams and Casjara's military things, and seems intent on actually setting up that interplanetary army.
