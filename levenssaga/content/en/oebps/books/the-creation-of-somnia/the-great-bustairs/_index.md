blurb: "All creatures collaborate to build a gigantic staircase towards the heavens. The most impressive and tallest structure they ever made. The gods don't understand why, but they do know they aren't allowed to reach too high ... "

With a gigantic staircase

Creatures hoped to grow wings

One step at a time

They reached toward heavens

&nbsp;

But the plan is precarious

Even the gods out of their depth

And the air up high is treacherous

Soon no breathing soul is left
