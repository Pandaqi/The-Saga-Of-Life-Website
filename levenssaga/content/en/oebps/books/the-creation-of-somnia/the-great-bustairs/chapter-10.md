Dilova could hardly believe her eyes when she received an invitation to visit Atheeni. Autumn had arrived. Everyone was allowed to celebrate the start of the new season with the gods.

But Dilova was special, because she could come early and deliberate with the gods themselves. Since that first dive flight she had tried again, this time from branches or the Maybemountains. 

And it worked. 

She could fly, she could steer upwards, she could fly above everything forever.

Well, until she got tired and needed food. She taught the other birds, but only the younger ones managed. Most were still too afraid of falling and that's exactly why they fell. The animals had already come up with a word: _diving birds_ quickly became known as _doves_.

As the proud first of her kind, she stepped onto the square with the gods. _Wow wow wow_, she thought repeatedly. 

The ground consisted of warm colored stones depicting all the gods. Pillars stood all around, displaying carved symbols and drawings that undoubtedly told Eeris' fairy tales, finished off with her familiar ivy. The bottom of the pillars was hidden under piles of reddish-brown leaves. In baskets, spread across the square, lay food for all the animals.

But the gods didn't even notice Dilova was there.

"We have to stand united," said Eeris. "Be friends with our subjects. Provide protection, provide comfort."

"For the umpteenth time," said Bella, "we are the gods, not them. We don't have to pretend we're best friends."

"And indeed, you never walk among the animals," Eeris bit back. "But I hear, every second of every day, of their hatred. How everything we do is wrong."

"Yes, and the one time I go visit the elephants in the South---a nice chat to improve our bond---I have to rush back because you've made a mess of things!"

"Sisters," said Ardex, as his tiger paw bumped against a pillar. "How often must I remind you? This is what Father wanted. Unrest, division, until we brought about our own downfall. Standing united means more than just bailing each other out at the last moment when someone has messed up."

"I didn't mess up," said Eeris. "I had it completely under control."

Cosmo sighed and flew to the middle. "We're family. Let's act like family. Trust each other. I won't tell Ardex how fire works, I trust he knows it best."

Darus smiled. "You know, if anyone lectures me about stone again I'll banish them from my mountains forever."

"Not all mountains are yours."

"I suggest," Bella said as loudly as possible, "we try a different approach. First off, yes, the Dracs really need softening and improving. One step at a time, I'd almost say."

All the gods nodded in agreement. Dilova nodded along unseen. 

"Besides, there's only seven of us and the world is vast. The animals already form their own groups. Based on friendship, shared food or lifestyle. Why don't we let them choose their own leaders and make rules? They form _Clansteads_ and we are merely the glue holding it all together."

"Good idea," said Darus, "but how do you want to soften the Dracs? If you murder someone, Ardex only half burns you? Or if you steal you just get an angry lecture?"

"I think we need to move away from the fire theme," said Eeris. "Wrap them in leaves?"

"Nonsense," said Ardex, "fire is the best theme."

Bella's head spun rapidly. She noticed Dilova standing there, so she cleared her throat and spoke warmly: "It seems we have a visitor."

"Oh, yes, hi, I didn't mean to interrupt."

"How is your father doing?"

"Better. Sometimes. He doesn't stare at the sky all day anymore. Sometimes he says something other than _there was nothing_."

Bella's eyes saddened. "Unpleasant things like this, we really must prevent."

Cosmo held back a ball of frustration. "How can I ever guide creatures if they suddenly get ideas for no reason? Some Supreme God in which they suddenly believe, wholly and stupidly?"

"I don't know either. But we'll have to learn. No creature should live in so much fear it breaks their mind." 

All the gods moved to the center of the square. One by one they bumped their snouts, or beaks.

"I love you all, never forget that," Bella said softly. "We have each other."

"I wish Hanah was here," Eeris mumbled.

_Who's Hanah?_ Dilova thought. 

She felt the urge to jump into the hug, but she could never see the gods as "best friends". They were too powerful, They could change the direction of the entire world at any moment. Or still set you on fire.

She talked with the gods about the doves, who als received the nickname _pigeons_. As real birds, they were given permission to fly anywhere, as they don't claim territory.

The Gosti had all left in time, but the other animal species had lost many members during the stair disaster. Dilova could tell the gods that the animals were indeed angry and sad, but also understood it wasn't their fault.

She advised the gods to open their gates again to everyone after all. To make the Throne of Tomorrow that beautiful place she'd heard of as a child.

The Proto-Turtles stuck to the agreement and didn't cause any more problems. _But looks can be deceiving, dear reader. You can be sure of that with arrogant Abrahon._

The next day, thousands of animals came to Atheeni to celebrate the start of Autumn. The gods urged them to never be afraid of unfair punishment. That they could always come to them with a problem. That their intentions were good.

Although some animals had other intentions.

Dilova flew innocently through the sky. Each time her wings could caress the wind still felt like magic. Cosmo flew alongside her often enough. He frequently said nothing, but she saw the pleasure in his eyes above that impressive orange beak. 

This time she headed for the moon alone, when below her a group of snakes slithered between pillars at the edge of Atheeni. They bashed against them until they loosened. Once their bodies were tightly wrapped around the marble pillar, they stole them away---

To Abrahon waiting in the sea. "We will have our revenge, don't you worry," he said.

"The gods will burn you if you dare come ashore!"

"Yes, we'll nicely and obediently stick to the agreement. We found another way to grow until we can destroy the gods for good."

_And so it was that life continued ..._
