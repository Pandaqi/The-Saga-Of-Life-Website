## 1. The Fear Volcano
Ardex discovers that Bella has been kidnapped. Immediately thinks it was the Ancient Tortoises. Runs in their direction and in the meantime makes the Fear Volcano out of anger.

Animals now live in villages/cities, some houses made of stone. Eastern Woods still quite uninhabitable.

Meets Cosmo and Eeris. They take him back to the Throne where the Book of Life is. The last person to visit Bella was _Leion_ from _Paraat_, who mentioned a big problem and wanted Bella to come along. She refused.

They split up (Cosmo + Eeris to Paraat, Ardex to Ancient Tortoises)

## 2. The Scared Paraat
Leion has to do a challenge where he (before the end of the day) steals food without getting caught. But he almost gets caught because he only relies on his running, and is otherwise not stealthy or clever.

He goes along with the culture of Paraat, but also hates it. Tikidas (the teacher) sees him as a failure, but gives him one last chance.

The gods reveal that Leion had stopped by and ask Paraat if they know anything. (Tikidas says Leion has to leave then.)

Paraat claims innocence, because everyone is good and follows their laws, and they would have stopped kidnappers.

But they do mention that animal species are fleeing something in the west.

## 3. The Wood-o-matics
Ardex at the Midterrace. But no Ancient Tortoises anywhere to be seen and they don't respond to his questions. (Mentions the gods' help in the West some time ago, and the help to the Ancient Tortoises even longer ago.)

He sees a wheel he doesn't understand (Ektro = light). When he crosses a border, the forest starts moving entirely automatically and traps him.

He can't do anything but flee and walk around the forest (Elwoda). Speaks to the snakes in the city. They don't take him seriously and are clearly of one mind with the Ancient Tortoises.

Ardex also hears about the animals in the west, but ignores it, because heading east he hopes to find out more about the Ancient Tortoises (or the animals they're working with).

## 4. The high demands
Leion has followed the gods after all. They meet Feria.

She has been in Preza, an area on Garda, a completely different continent than where the other gods operate (left of Origina, separated by water).

The kidnappers sent their demands to her: the gods must disappear from this world. But they don't really suspect Preza, because the gods don't know them, and they have no reason to be angry.

Leion notices (thanks to his training) raccoon claws in the surroundings. So they know they have to head roughly westwards to Darus' wall.

The gods reveal they can't actually leave. Leion reminds them to come up with a plan B, is surprised at how the gods think everything they come up with will work.

The gods consider Paraat to be savages/barbarians, because of the harsh things they do to their children.

Then they realize there is only one option for the invaders from the west: they must have crossed over Darus' mountains.

## 5. The turtle friends
Ardex visits Geiser Sand, a village on the northeast coast. Discovers they are very positive about the Ancient Tortoises and have a good bond with them. (Their prosperity comes from them.)

Hibb reminds him of the previous attack in the west and that the gods supported their own animals at the time. But the gods didn't know those intruders were from another continent (= the Prize Takers), they thought it came from their own sea.

The snake tells about his kidnapped wife and that they are asking for ransom (= another reference to the Prize Takers) Ardex realizes the numbers on the gate could be ransom.

Ardex still refuses to believe they are positive about the Ancient Tortoises, thinks they are enchanted.

Equids arrive and bring news. They have named the volcano the _Fear Volcano_. The kidnappers threaten to murder Bella if the gods don't show up.

Ardex wants to return, but thinks it's a trick/distraction, and stays east.

## 6. The Mountain Roamers
Gods meet Darus. He claims no one could ever have crossed the mountain. (Except for birds, but they can't kidnap Bella.)

Leion realizes they must have gone through the mountain, or under it.

Darus thinks it's nonsense and leaves to speak to Gulvi. The rest investigate his tunnel system, one creature per passage. Leion thinks he's hit a dead end, but then he hears shifting, then suddenly there is light, and tiny animals emerge from the wall.

They are the Mountain Roamers. They fled from the Prize Takers and used the diamonds in the mountain to pay them. After years of digging through the mountain, in very small tunnels, they shrunk themselves and developed claws.

Cosmo then realizes how everything is connected.

## 7. The prison
Cosmo explains that in the previous fight against the Prize Takers (that previous time an attack came from the west) the gods supported their animals, and the Preza from Garda didn't appreciate that, so now they come straight for the gods' heart. (And Cosmo reminds that they kill the animals if the price isn't paid on time.)

They go to Thon, the region they supported back then, where the Preza likely first came ashore.

Gulvi didn't do anything, because they threatened to hurt Bella. Leion warns, but too late, and Cosmo triggers another "wood-o-matic" that clamps shut around them as a prison.

Kajar (Prize Taker prince) explains they initially also wanted gold, lots of gold. But then they realized they could ask for more for a goddess.

Gulvi and Darus partially break open the prison and join them. Kajar's patience runs out: he threatens to murder Bella if the gods take one more step.

Leion uses everything he learned about stealth ... to sneak away and run back to Paraat for help.

## 8. The marathon
Leion runs. Takes those new passages through the mountains. Runs and runs until completely exhausted, passing groups of creatures also fleeing along the Green Path, through the Back Door, until he arrives in Paraat.

There he can just say the gods want their help at "Mare a Thon", before he passes out. (Tikidas very impressed by this achievement.)

When he wakes up, it's a day later. He can't even move anymore.

Paraat promises to come ... but according to their rules they have to wait two days before getting involved in a conflict, so you have time to reconsider.

Leion feels powerless, but senses they will come too late.

## 9. The last wish
The gods keep Kajar busy. Ask for cooperation, challenge him about the Juradom, how Preza is hated even more than the gods.

Kajar still tries subtly to find out exactly what the gods' powers are, how they work. Then Gulvi reveals they can't actually leave. That gives Kajar something to think about.

The gods think they hear help coming. Paraat or Ardex, someone is coming. So they walk backwards, pulling the jaguars along until they stand helplessly in the middle, far from safe walls.

But in the end no one comes. Cosmo thought he heard the Mountain Roamers. The sun rises, time is up, they have to make a choice now.

But Kajar realizes he has to change the price. (He asked for something impossible, a great disgrace for a prince of Preza.) He asks the gods: "tell me how we can destroy you?"

Feria whispers the gods' Secret, how to defeat them. (Our all-knowing narrator doesn't dare tell the reader.)

As soon as Bella is in sight, Kajar drops her and runs away from Origina with his entire group. A distraught Bella returns to her family.

## 10. Epilogue
Paraat did come, but too late. Feel very guilty, gods are mostly angry and brush them aside.

Ardex regrets even more that he was stuck on the idea that the Ancient _Tortoises must have done it. His volcano rumbles, he is temporarily the gods' spokesperson.

Tikidas reports they are building an army, to help the gods take revenge on Preza. The Delja: avengers. Five group settlements have already joined, including the Dwarves (= Mountain Roamers shortened)

The automatic forests and prisons still puzzle the gods, but the animals call it Electro = Godlight.

Leion says Paraat devised a challenge named after him: the Marathon, running his legendary route as fast as possible again. He's done with it. He leaves to travel the world and meet as many animals as possible.

Hanah returns (after a long time) to her family, at the same moment Bella awakens. She is for the first time ... scared to death. Because the gods revealed their secret, and now her entire family, the love of her life, is vulnerable.

Bella remains kind and wants to go back to how it was. But Ardex sees: she is no longer the bear she was.
