## 1. The Battle of Baroke
The two sides are fighting. The rhino side is shooting arrows.

The elephant side has apes, foxes, deer (with large antlers), wolves with shields.

They wonder where their ground troops are, because they can't find anything.

Then the sisters appear, in their time travel clock, in the middle of the battlefield. They were actually supposed to go to Floria. But since they're here, Jacintah (place bender) wants to help.

Ismaraldah sees they have bullets and gunpowder. She doesn't think that belongs here. So just as Jacintah has walked outside, she travels back to another time.

## 2. Time Travel for Beginners
She ends up in a strange place: two suns, water everywhere, and a floating egg. (Just like the legend of Ra the Sun God from "the Pearl Pyramid".)

She takes the egg with her.

Then she ends up on a cloud. The Chiefcloud commands the dinosaurs to see creatures "beneath them" as subordinates and punish them. She feels for him, but doesn't want to stick around ("not more goodbyes"), so she only says a comet is coming and Donte might be able to save himself.

Then she finally arrives at the desired place: a wild river between high cliffs, where a cat on a bridge discovers the secret of gunpowder. She changes it so he thinks he needs _parsley_, but she doesn't think that's enough, so she breaks the bridge and lets him plunge into the water. (Below they're busy with the Chinese race, comes in a later story.)

And then she returns to the battlefield. One of the wolves used her as a shield.

Her sister has already helped this side, but she wants to stay out of it. A fox convinces her, however, to do _something_. So when she sees pigeons flying in, she makes a time bubble: she breathes out, and as long as the breath floats in the bubble, time in that area goes _very_ slowly.

But there are too many. Exhausted, she falls down and the battle cheerfully continues. But an unknown creature drags her away.

## 3. Comrades without King
It turns out to be a badger, both intimidating/muscular, as well as soft and sweet. He is one of the last members of the _Comrades without King_.

A group that doesn't want to belong anywhere, but generally puts out fires and wants to keep the peace.

He's the only one here. The rest have their own mission (which was even more difficult).

He asks Ismaraldah to please help stop the fighting. She has often searched for these comrades, but could never find them and thought they were a legend.

They examine the battlefield, but the house is gone. Jacintah must be nearby, because the threatening arrows above their heads switch places at the last moment.

The apes took her house. They run to the entrance and look for a way inside. But before they succeed, Didrik is gone, and the apes have taken Ismaraldah prisoner.

## 4. Double Life
Ismaraldah is thrown into prison. Didrik comes by to free her.

They discuss her house. Can float through space, made of magical wood.

Didrik identifies that egg as a _dragon egg_. But it wasn't that originally. Ismaraldah is reminded of one of the rules: never take an egg through time, you change what hatches from it.

Ismaraldah implies that traveling along in the clock can have rather unpleasant consequences.

They end up on the _other_ side of the battlefield. And they accidentally traveled back in time again, before the archers fired their arrows.

Ismaraldah tells Didrik he has to go back to where he was, otherwise they'll never meet, a paradox will be created, and then he'll die.

Didrik runs away, Ismaraldah hides in the bushes, especially when a very long snake comes along.

A hyena addresses the troops. Certain that Ismaraldah/Jacintah are there, because he spoke to them as a traveler and let slip that the battle today is in Baroke.

Then he smells someone nearby.

## 5. Finding the clock back
Didrik storms into the other side. They first think he's a spy, until he predicts the future (pigeons coming, archers shooting arrows) and greatly helps them with it.

The ape general asks if he, together with the sisters, can go back even further and prevent the battle from taking place at all. He can't promise anything, but does his best.

He sits in the bushes, waiting to meet Ismaraldah again ... but she doesn't come. Then realizes that _everything_ is different, because he shared information he wasn't supposed to know.

Falls asleep exhausted and lonely. But Jacintah shakes him awake and wants to find her sister together with him again. She does reveal that Ismaraldah's explanation to Didrik is therefore _incorrect_.

## 6. Castle Orders
Didrik notices more and more effects of time and space travel. Jacintah suddenly kisses him out of nowhere.

The broken arrows are from Ismaraldah: she always draws a little clock in the mud. They follow footsteps in the mud until they abruptly stop.

They test the ground until they find a hidden door/hatch. Fall through it, Didrik throws her on his back, and runs.

They end up in a castle. They hide from two ferrets, but Jacintah is too impulsive and doesn't want to hold her breath any longer.

She attacks, but is defeated. Didrik wants to save her, but stays in the shadows, so he can follow unseen. He wants to plan, smart missions, always stay unseen---he doesn't care for this improvising with the pandas.

Jacintah says she knows the castle lord. Ferrets laugh at her, because they have a castle lady.

Didrik peeks from outside the door: Ismaraldah is nonchalantly sitting at the head of the table.

## 7. The Grass is Always Greener
Ismaraldah only wants to talk to Jacintah. The castle lady (Castela) honors the request.

Everyone runs out of the room. Didrik has to flee quickly, hangs behind a mirror. Seems to work, until Castela lingers and gets angry about her broken mirror.

It becomes clear it's a window toward the ape kingdom, so the apes and she can keep an eye on each other. (Also confirms the control apes want to exert, with their rules, laws, and windows in other people's castles.)

Didrik attacks her. They fight, but he wins easily. Castela reveals she also used to be a Comrade of the King. Allows him to stay and talk to Ismaraldah.

Ismaraldah sees a way to stop the fighting. Tomorrow evening they'll kidnap the Ape Lord and force him to stop enforcing their rules on the whole area.

Didrik listens. Jacintah wants nothing to do with it.

Ismaraldah reveals why she really sent Didrik away. If they go too far forward or backward, they'll reach a point where he wasn't alive yet, and he would die instantly. She cares for him, she was afraid something might happen to him.

She bursts into tears saying how hard it is to constantly meet creatures and have to say goodbye again. (She's been doing this work for a _very_ long time.)

Didrik comforts her and holds her before she can sneak away again. Jacintah has had enough and disappears.

## 8. Always a Secret Plan
Didrik and Ismaraldah cuddle for a long time after. They're brought to sleeping quarters. He just can't sleep, Ismaraldah is out immediately.

He doubts whether he's doing the right thing. Whether Jacintah shouldn't have stayed. About his promise to the ape lord.

Then he feels a sword at his throat. Jacintah revealed to Castela that he actually made a promise to the ape lord.

He feels completely betrayed, Castela is ready to kill him, but then Jacintah teleports everyone she touches.

Right into the middle of the ape kingdom. The owl alarm immediately goes off. Apes come and take everyone prisoner.

They convince them that Castela is _not_ their friend and has all the villains in her castle. But Castela talks her way out of it and is allowed to walk away to sign a declaration of peace, which has to be back in the ape kingdom by early afternoon.

Didrik wants to go back to rescue Ismaraldah. The apes take them to see the Ape Lord. Jacintah only wants to continue alone. Didrik convinces her she should give her sister more of a chance, take that first step herself to start trusting each other again.

So she pulls him into the bushes without the apes noticing, and says this was always her plan.

## 9. Fate
Didrik convinces Jacintah to finally go find her sister and go for something _together_.

They walk to the campfire where the front line (of the apes) is chatting and eating.

They hear stories.


* Arap who says the apes secretly have a gigantic army and could easily win, but refuse. They find all violence wrong. But he wants it to stop.
* The lion who had promised to return home soon, but his child Amowe (love lion) will be a year old by now
* The jackal, Jaco's son, who left Floria but now desperately wants to go back
* A younger wolf who wants to return to his loved one and friends in Traferia, run carefree through the woods, even though half that continent hates wolves
* Chimp (chimpanzee) who brings everyone together and tells stories about brotherhood and togetherness

(Apparently they've been fighting with this army for a year already, although not necessarily in this one spot.)

It should be light by now, but it remains dark: next rain of arrows.

Jacintah and Didrik return, with some problems (because alone she can't steer the clock well), to the castle to rescue Ismaraldah.

Ismaraldah finally explains why this battle is a "fixed point": this world has to learn to fight and make weapons, because in the future an alien people will come and they need to be prepared!

They go to the Ape Lord before the battle starts. Didrik doesn't convince him.

Ismaraldah shows him how it's done, convinces them, and they watch from a distance as the apes leave to stop Castela right now.

Jacintah returns the egg, but because she

Didrik wants to continue adventures. Ismaraldah cries again and explains he can't come along. That she always has to leave everyone behind, because she's the only one outside the timeline, the rest just die, and Didrik already feels awfully sick.

But he doesn't care. He wins her love and trust, says he'll always wait for her and she can always come by, and she seems to accept that.

## Epilogue
They send letters to everyone who sat around the campfire back then, so they can attend the birth of Viowe's daughter (Amowe).

They all come. It's cozy, it's a nice reunion. Chimp wants to play coconut football, but he's the only animal that can stand. They decide to play shuffle hockey instead: a sport the jackal suggests, who's from Floria, where you simply slide a disk over the ground with your paws.

Didrik gives a magical piece of _Dragontimber_ as a gift (because "they have their connections")

Ismaraldah and Didrik cuddle and kiss, very happy together. Viowe says he's famous, a hero, even though he doesn't know why (because yes, that Battle of Baroke never happened to him).

Didrik says he got kicked out of the comrades. And how awful it is he can never constantly travel along with Ismaraldah.

But maybe, even if it's risky, he found a solution ...
