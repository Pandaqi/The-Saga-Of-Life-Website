Two friends found themselves 

caught in a battle intense

A fight they would wish

had never commenced

&nbsp; 

They played with great forces

they played with the time

But hatred and conflict

was all they would find

&nbsp;

How can she ever decide 

how can this goddess turn the tide

She wants no winners nor losers, 

but the fighting must subside
