blurb: "The climate has turned. The loss of sunlight makes it hard for plants and animals to survive. So when humans start sending spaceships into the galaxy, only one option remains: secretly come along before the Last Rocket has left."

An air blackened and dark

Thanks to planes and satellites

Blocked all the sun's light rays

Leaving plants bereft of life

&nbsp;

The people fled in their steel domes

Or stubbornly hid in their square homes

But if the clouds couldn't clear this stain

Soon, no animal nor plant would remain
