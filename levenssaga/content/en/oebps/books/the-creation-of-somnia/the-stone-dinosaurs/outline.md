## 1. The River
Mami is thirsty and waiting by the river. The Small Animals have a kind of agreement: one person comes out of the hiding place. No dino attacks? The rest come too. (And otherwise it's end of story for that one.)

But Mami is insecure and doesn't belong to a group. (She is a Ghost, but her family has abandoned her.)

So she goes late, bumps into a dino (Donte). But the "agreement" applies, so all the other Small Animals see this as a reason to reappear.

In the chaos Donte falls over, with dead or injured Small Animals as a result. Mami breaks her hind leg.

The rest are angry at them. Donte takes her onto his back. (Donte is a plant eater, a dreamer, doesn't really belong with the rest of the herd.)

Then it's foggy: a cloud (Willi) has come down close to the ground. Why? Strange news: a panda who said an asteroid was heading for the dinos.

Donte runs away toward the Dino Nest to warn them, Mami on his back.

(There is a kind of divide in the world: the mighty Dinosaurs, mainly the largest and the meat eaters, against the Small Animals, which, well, all the others are.)

## 2. The Dino Nest
Mami and Donte arrive at the nest. She is impressed and tells some facts about dinos: that they had feathers, that they hatch from eggs, that everything looks small from Donte's back.

Donte thinks he can convince the dinos, take Mami with him and protect her. But they want to eat her and don't believe his story about the apocalypse. (Especially because they work closely with clouds and those have just said they need to be even stricter with their _underlings_.)

Rexes says the gods have stolen their eggs. (Doesn't come back in this story, but later it will.) That they only help Small Animals, that dinos are no longer afraid of the gods.

Things get out of hand, Donte is kicked out of the herd and declared an outlaw. He has to flee from the hunters. They roll along "The Long Neck" (the river they live around) and end up at the Wise Sea, where Feria angrily adresses them.

## 3. The Tree of Life
They are with Feria. She heals Mami's hind leg, takes them to the Tree of Life (her throne) in the middle of the Wise Sea.

But she is aloof and angry toward Donte. Explains how nature is getting out of balance, how the dinos have spread this far by now and are taking bites from her tree. She sends Donte away.

She explains that the Ghosts were the "most intelligent species" she ever made, "pure wisdom". And that they still are ... at the moment.

But then she whistles a melody ( = a call to her family members to come) and hurries away, together with Mami. Because they have known about the asteroid for a long time and her family was actually planning on letting it through.

## 4. The Throne of Tomorrow
Mami ends up at the throne of the gods, where the rest are as well (except Ardex, who could not come)

Feria says the dinos now _know_ an asteroid is coming. They vote again. Mami's fear/hatred of dinos still wins out and she says the asteroid should go through, but that they can _pretend_ to stop it.

The vote is tied. Then Small Animals burst in. The dinos are busy marching toward the throne of the gods and destroying everything in their path.

Feria has no choice but to cast the deciding vote: they will let the asteroid through.

## 5. Donte's Dream
Donte walks back to the Dino Nest by a roundabout route. He is still determined to convince everyone and flee together. He still sees himself as one of the dinosaurs.

It's so hot and dry (he's been walking a day already), that he goes to the river anyway. There he finds a battlefield. An enormous amount of dead Small Animals. As he walks to the water himself, a large horned dino attacks him.

He nearly loses, but then a second dinosaur helps him: Nisah.

She explains what's going on: the clouds are sucking up all the water and refusing to let it rain. That's why the Small Animals eventually had to go to the river en masse to drink, where the dinos laid a trap. They've done that all along the river.

Slowly Dino realizes he might not want to belong to this group after all. That it might not be worth fighting for them.

Because now the Dino Nest is empty, and Rexes on his way to the gods in the hope of overthrowing them and becoming the sole ruler.

Nisah seems to know a whole lot, but doesn't want to say how she knows. (Like that the gods are lying when they say they're immortal.)

He gets a small connection with the Small Animals, but not enough for trust. Night falls. He can now see the asteroid, as a point of light high in the sky. He decides for himself, and anyone who wants to join him, to look for a safe place.

## 6. Up the Tree
Mami tries climbing, doesn't really work yet. She describes Ghostville: where the Ghosts live, shrouded in a kind of gray mist by the blows of a large ghost bird throwing stuff into the air.

Goes there to warn, to belong somewhere again. But they reject her. (She works with dinos, she's clumsy, squashed their fellow Ghosts.)

But as she walks away, a dino storms through Ghostville at them. She rescues a number of Ghosts and teaches them to climb trees. But before they can thank her, she has already left. She realizes Donte's dream wasn't so crazy, if they adapt a little too. She regrets her decision and wants to undo it.

## 7. Donte's Deed
Donte and Nisah run through the forest looking for animals to rescue, to spread the message. The yield is low. Until they talk to a group of lizards. Among the Small Animals there is actually a lot of faith in the gods. They take care of them, they will stop the asteroid, etc.

Nisah says the gods are not going to do this. Otherwise they would have done it long ago. The Small Animals find that interesting and slowly they get more and more creatures to join the group.

Until they are at the Tree of Life. Donte wants Feria to stop the asteroid after all. She says it's not possible, that they don't want to play with nature, that they are gods and normal beings will never understand that.

But she does tell them where a safe place is and that the gods will take care of them there. The group walks on, but Donte and Nisah go back. He thinks there are still more animals to rescue, that it's worth keeping the gods as rulers of the world (and not the cruel dinos)

## 8. The Falling Stars
Mami lands on Donte's head (she can already climb trees better). Reveals that she prompted the gods to this plan, that she feels guilty, but thinks the gods will listen if she says something else now.

So Donte and she run to the Throne, where the gods defend themselves against the dinosaurs. The gods stand their ground, but can never win, because they remain too kind.

Until Ardex returns from having been away, sets fire to everything and chases the dinos back to the Maw of Din. (Small Animals flee from this burning forest.)

And then the asteroid is so close that everyone sees it. Rexes refuses to look up. The dinos go back to their nest. But a group of feathered dinos isn't fast enough, isn't the same, and stays behind.

They see the Small Animals fleeing on Donte's back. They do the same and thus allow themselves to become _Taxeies_.

And then the asteroid hits.

## 9. The Fire Flight
The gods are just as surprised. It starts as a white circle in the distance, but soon there are earthquakes, floods, the circle growing toward them.

The dinos and Small Animals flee. While the disaster keeps getting closer, while the sky grows ever darker. The feathered dinos discover more and more that they can fly small distances and use that. (Because rifts open up, fiery meteors come down, the ground is hot.)

The godly children finally take action and do everything they can to stop and soften it.

Mami sees the "Ghost Birds" (the large winged creatures that made their Ghostville) flee in time, she hopes, she thinks.

They find a cave. Everyone goes inside ... but there isn't enough room for both Donte and Nisah. Donte wants to be a hero and let Nisah in.

Nisah thinks the opposite and pushes him inside. With the help of Eeris (goddess of nature, of course) they seal the entrance of the cave shut.

They wait in the dark until the disaster passes. When they come out, the whole world is a winter landscape.

## 10. Epilogue
All the dinos have become Stone Dinosaurs, because of the magma that hardened around them. The Ghosts take good care of Donte, can now climb trees, and he thinks it's out of Mami's guilt.

The winged dinos are on their way to becoming the first _birds_.

The gods say they didn't expect it to be so extreme. They had only had one previous impact (beginning of Banished Family), and that was no big deal, but the difference was that the world didn't have life yet back then. The gods regret it. Eeris is pissed off and blames her whole family.

They decide to interfere more, go against the rules of nature more in order to protect their world.

Three-quarters of the world has gone extinct. Donte searches for Nisah, Mami feels she has to care for the dinos forever. And the Second Ice Age has begun.
