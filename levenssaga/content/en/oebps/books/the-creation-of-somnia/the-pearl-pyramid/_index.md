blurb: "A predator and prey have to explore a pyramid filled with traps---together---always on the run from cruel shadowshifters. They're looking for the second part of an important legend about pyramids and gods, but find something entirely different."

---

An adventurer and his strange sidekick

Traversed the desert, quite nimble and quick

Chased by foul beasts with ill intent

They found the treasure for which they were sent

&nbsp;

But the pyramid's path was filled with great risk

Of traps that were vicious for those not so brisk

How will they make it back home safe and sound?

For something inside this old tomb is unsound
