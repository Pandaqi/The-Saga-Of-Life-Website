## 1. A New Face
Ardex awakens. Discovers the planet: he recognizes it as "hell", with churning lava, explosions, hot, barely any solid ground.

Discovers his own change, discovers loss/gain of powers. Notices he feels rather unwell: is afraid father did something, that they are missing something here that will cause them to die.

He teaches us about the gods, family, being sent away by father. The powers he used to have but no longer does. The idea of _Zyme_: the gods do nothing but slowly steer and let the world bloom.

Ardex "crumbles" the longer he is on this planet.

(Darus briefly helps him to stabilize the planet by putting a magnet in the core. Some fussing, goes back to sleep again.)

## 2. The Wise Raccoon
We meet BELLA. Explains that they are missing something, tells her theory of life force. Explains that the gods were flung away from each other: the lighter you are, the farther away.

She teaches us about life force. Why they might _not_ simply survive here. Mentions they have already seen other "life" and helped it. But knowing it's _possible_ is not the same as _knowing how to make it_.

## 3. In the Vacuum
We meet COSMO. Notices he can see everything in their solar system---they are missing an _atmosphere_.

Explains that the sun also flings lighter particles farther away. They have a lot of OXYGEN, because that's heavy. But HYDROGEN has to come from farther planets.

Also mentions CARBON: can easily form bonds with everything, there's a lot of it in the universe.

Darus comes running back in a panic: a gigantic meteorite is about to crash.

## 4. The Moon and the Mountain
DARUS makes mountains (the Impassable Wall of Darus) as defense against the meteorite.

The fragments that break off become (by Cosmo+Darus) warped into _the moon_. COSMO explains why that's important, partly through gravity. Also says a _kind of_ air forms around the planet, but it's a very thick air of carbon dioxide, hot and suffocating.

Here we really get to know Darus. Realizes the crashing rocks from planets come from _farther away_. So they must have hydrogen! But his powers are too weakened to attract more rocks and get the water out.

The fight between Darus and Ardex intensifies, partly because of this.

## 5. The Barren Gardens
EERIS tried to make plants. She can make things that _look_ like plants, but they aren't ( = the barren gardens). The gods slowly realize they might die here.

Ardex refuses to accept that. He asks everyone to think about how they can make _life_. That's how they come up with various properties: has to be able to move/change, double and grow, needs carbon and water. Slowly they get closer to an idea of what _life force_ could be.

The crust is already closing. They have to make the right choice now if they still want to save it. Ardex takes control and forces everyone to look for Feria, making Darus even angrier.

## 6. The Energy to Keep Going
They come upon a "not yet born" rabbit---FERIA had tried to make this but has the same problem as Eeris. They make things that _look_ like the life they know, but of course it's not alive. They think way too big and goal-oriented.

She mentions the importance of energy, with which the discussion about "what is life" sort of ends. But they can't do anything with it anymore. They are too weak to gather extra energy from the sun. The hot air currents (kind of like geysers, not exactly) are an option, but they don't work either.

Darus is completely fed up. His fight with Ardex reaches a climax: the planet breaks into pieces and lava rivers throw everything around.

## 7. The Particle Soup
Darus is immediately cheerful: he made tectonic plates. The crust is open again briefly, allowing crashing rocks to fall into the lava and make water (hydrogen from rock + oxygen in the planet).

This way the atmosphere becomes lighter and less oppressive, more and more like we know it.

Eeris sees how the plates are mirrors of each other. How the magma rises and precisely fills the jagged/broken edges. And that is their answer: life begins with two things that fit each other perfectly. Break them apart and new particles fill the other sides. That's how you double yourself.

They use the hot air currents ... and it works. A few particles double. The crumbling stops, for the first time they feel better again, powers return. They make DNA!

But when the stream stops, everything is gone again. They have to be able to do this the whole time. Bella realizes they need to put the particles in _water_ for that.

They look for Gulvi. Light being, so must have been flung farther away, might have gone north himself where it's colder. (Cosmo flies the other way, as far as he can.)

They find GULVI boiling hot, dried out, and at death's door.

## 8. The Heavenly Palace
Ardex slowly realizes this might be the end. And that his family was always most important. So he hastily starts rebuilding the heavenly palace for them.

HANAH visits him. Explains that she is doing just fine. That she doesn't _want_ to help, but has to if they want to survive. She says they have to take it slow. Not immediately try to establish all of life as they know it.

She says it's not his fault they were banished. It's her fault.

And she leaves. It's as if a weight falls from Ardex's shoulders.

Ardex starts over. But this time he builds the heavenly palace step by step, in small pieces, without haste. And he tells Cosmo (who finds him) to bring the same message to the others.

## 9. The Most Important Drop
They bring Gulvi to the highest point and throw him into the air. There he knows how to cool the floating hydrogen and change it into the first _rain_ on this planet, and soon the _First Sea_. He disappears (happily and a tad naively) to immediately make all kinds of extra rivers.

Eeris and Feria throw their "DNA" into the water. And indeed, now it can drift through the particle soup, now it can constantly find new pieces to connect with (also because of the hot air currents underwater). But it still goes much too slowly.

So they decide they need the _opposite_ of _Zyme_: Enzyme. Use their powers to extremely accelerate life instead.

It works. The splitting and doubling now happens very quickly. So fast that the particles fill up the sea and crawl like a carpet over the land.

Until sandy beings tear through it to break it down, and put the gods to sleep. They have life force, they discovered the secret, but they mustn't go too fast.

## 10. Epilogue
Hanah makes clear once more that she is not coming and they need to take it slow. The rest go (without her) to the heavenly palace. A magnificent staircase (with a waterslide next to it for Gulvi) leading to a throne room with a unique fitting throne for each god.

They stay a bit tired and hungry, but their powers return and they can live here now. Darus makes diamonds to his heart's content (and parts of the heavenly palace). The rest build things that look like trees/animals and hope they can someday _change_ them into real life.

Bella becomes the "leader" of the gods. The planet cools down. The ground is hard. They have oceans. There is no oxygen in the air but that's not so necessary right now.

The gods like building on the heavenly palace, but they also want their own throne _in_ the world. (In any case the Green Sisters have that wish very strongly.)

Bella divides roles:


* Ardex is enforcer. Ensures order, prevents conflict, is their defense
* Cosmo is messenger. (Suggests making atmospheric layers so life cannot escape.)
* Darus guards the mountain ranges, but is also for the fun and liveliness. (Jokingly suggests later telling creatures the world is flat.)

(In a sense they build all kinds of borders, because they are so afraid life will leave them again. The oceans, the mountains, the air layers, the mysterious force that stops you if you want to go south.)

They decide to stay here. And give this world more life than anywhere.
