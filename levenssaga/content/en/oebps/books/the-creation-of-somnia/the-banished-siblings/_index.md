blurb: "A family of demigods is banished by their fearsome Father to a burning planet. And transformed into animals. They must find answers and fast, for they won't survive long in this hellscape."

Out of fear or revenge, 

they no longer knew

On a barren planet they fell, 

banished too

&nbsp;

The ground was still lava, 

the skies were still dark

No plants grew to heavens, 

no animals had hearts

&nbsp;

In hope to give life 

in this burning world

Demigods swiftly turned 

every sea and land unfurled
