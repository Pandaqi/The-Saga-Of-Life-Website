blurb: "Turtle friends wonder where their underwater city comes from and why it seems to drift further away from land. With the secret aid of a Companion they try to solve the mystery before the land is too far away to lay eggs ... but nothing is as it seems."

Turtles once found a city so grand

Its magic built by skillful a hand

None thought to question, none took a stand

Who dwelt in this place before they did land?

&nbsp;

One elderly turtle was struck by this notion

And unearthed a gruesome, foul truth potion

To save all his friends from truly cruel fate

A mystery needs solving before it's too late
