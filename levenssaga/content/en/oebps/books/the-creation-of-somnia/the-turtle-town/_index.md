Turtles once found a city so grand

Its magic built by skillful a hand

None thought to question, none took a stand

Who dwelt in this place before they did land?

&nbsp;

One elderly turtle was struck by this notion

And unearthed a gruesome, foul truth potion

To save all his friends from truly cruel fate

A mystery needs solving before it's too late
