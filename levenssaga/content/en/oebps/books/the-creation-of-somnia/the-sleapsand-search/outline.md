## 1. The sleepless night
Meogg hears strange sounds. The Sand King visits her, tries to make her sleep, because roar frogs are the only animal species still evading him.

It doesn't work. He decides to work together instead: another ship is on its way to the same island because a secret weapon against birds is said to be located there. (The last Dodo Egg is supposed to be there.)

(Meogg's family has been fleeing from snakes for a long time, but all islands are full, so this island is their last hope.)

## 2. The Sand King
Claes goes to Olombos' ship to delay them. (We meet that voice in his head directing him, also to inform the Apra and make them come.)

He succeeds in putting Olombos to sleep, but the rest of the crew (mostly wild boars and foxes) pick it up. When he wants to put _everyone_ to sleep, and argues with the voice in his head for freedom, he gets caught by a group of foxes.

He flees head over heels, but gets a speech about what they're coming to do: that secret weapon, they think there's a Primordial Bird egg there. One fox seems to oppose the plan.

He sees that Olombos will arrive faster than Meogg.

## 3. The Law of First Landing
Meogg urges her family to sail faster, but roar frogs are a peaceful kind: sitting still for a long time, then jumping once or flicking out a tongue, and pausing again for a long time.

She goes to Parog. Tries to talk to him, but he says things she doesn't understand and stares past her. (Putting _b√∫r_ in front of something means it's your grandfather/grandmother.)

Meogg sees Olombos (and Claes coming back) and realizes they have to hurry. Their ship is built with floors, because that helps the frogs jump. But it also blocks a lot of wind and is super inconvenient.

So she takes Parog below deck, breaks everything apart piece by piece, until they go faster and faster, and eventually reach the island.

## 4. The two Sleep Stories
Claes wants to continue right away, but the voice tells him he can't say anything. He explains that he doesn't live like them, but gets directed. He's only allowed to tell two stories: the most beautiful story ever and the most horrible story ever. When an animal dies in its sleep, he takes them away, instead of the god of death.

Parog briefly comes to life and talks about his lost wife Ninog, who he thinks is still alive.

Claes becomes desperate, until he finds a Sigri plant on the island. With this the frogs can always keep their energy up.

They continue on. Claes says that Cosmo had to flee, that he left behind security that will have partly gone off, and partly not. So they have to pay close attention.

Which Holog does not do when he jumps ahead too enthusiastically and activates a catapult.

## 5. The clever Olombos
The catapult destroys their fast way onto the island. So they have to go around it and run EVEN faster, which Parog definitely can't handle, but the other frogs find difficult too.

Claes says the air is enchanted so no one can fly. And that the voice in his head even thinks gods can't enter the secret place.

Claes takes Meogg to Olombos' camp. Check if they're asleep, and if not, make sure they will.

Meogg saves them, with her good hearing, from the geysers that go off. Claes reveals the voice in his head wanted her along for that reason.

At the camp they see Olombos has taken precautions. They now watch out for sand grains, blow them away with plates between their teeth.

So Meogg has to stir up the camp and make them forget the precautions. She does this somewhat successfully, by jumping back and forth and loosening coconuts. The Sand King waits for the fleeing boars and immediately puts them to sleep.

But there are too many, and Meogg is in danger, so the Sand King spreads himself too thin and falls apart. His map and Sigri plant roll to Olombos, who gladly uses them.

They no longer need to sleep either and immediately continue on. Claes and Meogg walk back, and Claes realizes they have to go about it differently.

## 6. Parog's memory
They think all night and come up with a smarter plan. Cosmo fled, but on foot he's much slower than the rest. Much of the security didn't go off. So they expect he had a secret passageway.

They search until Meogg softly hears water behind the wall. They find where it streams the hardest and go through a secret door.

The water quickly becomes a churning river with a bridge over it that seems to never have been used. But feathers on the other side indicate Cosmo did pass that way.

Halfway across the bridge Parog suddenly comes to life. He lashes out wildly, says things they don't understand again, until he suddenly withdraws into himself once more.

But the bridge is broken. Meogg can just barely make it to the other side, the rest have to turn back and find another way. Meogg realizes more and more that Parog might not make it, might not get better, and asks the Sand King to tell him a nice story.

## 7. The bird advantages
Meogg hops on her own through the night. She loses all sense of time, what exactly she has done, now that she's done so much in a row. And her body hurts.

Olombos' group walks on the _other_ side of the wall. He is angry because birds can discover new islands so much more easily. He makes a huge effort and has only discovered one so far. He thinks they're cheating, stole powers, made a deal with the devil.

He's also not happy with the Apra and just wants to rename more of the world after himself in general.

Meogg is tired and distracted. She nearly falls, roars, and that's how the rest know something is on the other side. They start breaking through the wall.

She flees for a while until she hears she's in a cave and, blind and with her tongue, pulls herself to the ceiling.

The boars stand under her. They can't find her, but keep standing there, they only need to look up. Meogg considers distracting the boars, sacrificing herself for Parog and the rest.

A fox comes by and suggests Meogg might have gone the other way, that she really isn't here.

The boars leave. At the very last moment the fox looks up and winks at Meogg: they're secretly on her side.

## 8. The disappeared voice
Claes' group discovers bird skeletons. Cosmo indeed never used the bridge, he got cut off by a group of birds and took this other route.

Holog is surprised why birds would be angry at Cosmo, the hip cool bird god. Claes notices the voice in his head is suddenly gone. He explains his two stories (most beautiful and most horrible) are based on reality. And that Holog doesn't want to know the answer to his question.

They arrive almost at the top. A field with pouches, one of them has a Dodo egg, the rest empty. Above them is the blue cave, but it's high up and surrounded by thick trees, smooth rocks, rivers falling downhill, everything to form a sort of shield around this "sacred" place.

Meogg comes back and says the foxes are on their side. That brings the voice back in Claes' head, happy they're still loyal to Feria, goddess of animals.

And then, all the hints and thoughts combined, Claes realizes why everything is so confusing. They're not looking for one thing, but two things. Cosmo had two things on the island, and at the last moment he ran towards the other to protect one of them.

They don't walk to the top, but partway around it, towards an insignificant spot at the back of the rocks. There they find another opening.

Behind it they find the Egg Cave: Cosmo secretly kept playing egg thief for years and preserved eggs from all kinds of animal species in this space.

## 9. The bird magic
Scene 1: Claes fights his way up to hold back the boars. They're weakened by lack of sleep, and he puts some to sleep, but Olombos pounds on through. The foxes show their true nature and attack.

The cave opens. Inside lie the shards of Cosmo's Soul. Claes wants to follow Olombos, but can't enter the cave. The voice in his head says goodbye and leaves him, for the first time, alone with himself. He can go inside.

Scene 2: With her family Meogg has to pull out all the stops to save the eggs falling to the ground because of the violence. When it seems to go wrong, due to Meogg's exhausted body, Parog stands up one more time and saves them. All the eggs stay whole.

But two boars find the cave. They injure Meogg and Parog, after which foxes grab them again and throw them off the slope.

Scene 3: Meogg hears Claes is having a very hard time above. She goes along with the foxes. She's blind, her eyes don't work anymore either, so by sound she determines when she's close enough.

She roars loud, like roar frogs can, and paralyzes Olombos. Long enough for Claes to go to the shards (there were supposed to be ten, there are only five) and touch one of them.

His power---sleep grains---spreads through the entire airspace around the island. Meogg just sees birds and Apra arrive and immediately fall asleep. Then she sleeps herself.

## 10. Epilogue
Scene 1: Meogg wakes up, feels mostly recovered. (Though it's confusing now that she missed parts of the day.)

The Apra explain they'll become guardians of the Egg Cave. The Law of First Landing was difficult to enforce, because birds had actually already been there much earlier. But they decide frogs, foxes and birds can live together on the island now called Porto Volo.

Meogg looks for her family. They think one egg is missing from the cave. (Olombos' Egg.) She can't find Parog anywhere.

Scene 2: The voice comes back in Claes' head. But they come to a better understanding, although the voice still doesn't want to reveal anything, not even where she is now.

The foxes apologize: they didn't know the Sand King _existed_, let alone that he was on their side. That's why they attacked on the ship.

Claes realizes his sleeping mist also made the secret powers on the island sleep, which previously prevented anyone from flying.

But he still has something to do: Parog dies in his sleep, and Claes takes him as a winged horse, while he tells him the _beautiful_ story. (And reveals he used to be called _Vaec_, ancient dove for _sleep_.)
