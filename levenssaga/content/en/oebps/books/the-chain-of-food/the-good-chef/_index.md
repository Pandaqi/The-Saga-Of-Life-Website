The Good Chef knew all recipes

Except an old medicine, some unknown thing

A creature is ill and she must be his savior

But nasty plants and magic obstacles await her

&nbsp;

As if she dangles over a lake

Befuddled, befriended or betrayed

Her cauldron boils over, oh so quick

And the medicine might arrive too late
