As usual, the research for stories such as these is difficult. We have no certainty about the first animal who became venomous. The further back we go, the less proof we can find, and the more different life on earth must have been to what we know today. As such, this story is loosely based on what we _think_ we know.

The first sign of poison was found at the order of the _Conodont_. These small, worm-like fishes lived around 500 million years ago. They had sharp teeth that are well-preserved, which is why they're often found at excavation sites and used to date other fossils.

Then, we really only find venomous traits again at the order of _Euchambersia_, which lived around the same time as the dinosaurs. They were a mix between a lizard and a dog. Not the smallest species, but certainly not the biggest.

Snakes only appeared around 150 million years ago, halfway the dinosaur age. But we have no idea from whence they came. Maybe they came from the land, maybe from the sea. Maybe snakes were lizards who _lost_ their legs ... or lizards are snakes who _gained_ legs. Most proof points to the theory that snakes entirely lived on the land. So they used to have legs, then lost their front legs, and eventually lost their hind legs too.

_Sometime_ during that process they became venomous. And the way that happens is pure coincidence---as everything in evolution---and what I tried to explain in this story.

## How poison appears

This is the step-by-step plan.

* Our body constantly reads our _DNA_ to create proteins. Sometimes, because of a mistake, the location of the protein can change. Something that was supposed to be in your stomach, for example, now ends up in your mouth.
* At first, that protein won't do much.
* But over time, that protein can collect even _more_ mistakes, until it truly becomes dangerous for whoever receives your bite.
* Now it's become an _advantage_ to survival! You can win against larger animals by biting them. And so your venomous offspring stays alive---and your other offspring has more trouble.
* Repeat this cycle for millions of years, and now your entire species has the DNA for a very venomous bite.

Still, we have numerous examples of animals who _lost_ their venomous bite. Why? Because it also has a very high **biological price**. You have to constantly spend energy and resources to make those extra particles. So, if the price is higher than the gain, it will be an advantage _not_ to have it. So you lose it again.

Similarly, we see that poison evolved several times in several, unconnected places. Animal species who have never met or lived in the same area, received the same capability for poison all the same. That's how strong this advantage is, especially during a time when almost all animals are bigger than you. (Think of the dinosaurs, of course. But following their time, the world was still populated by many larger versions of animals we know today, such as giant wolves.)

Despite every version of poison using a different particle, the _effect_ is always the same: it either paralyzes your nerves (so you can't move or defend yourself) _or_ it prevents blood from clotting (so that wounds never heal). This was apparently easiest to accomplish or gave you the biggest chance of killing your attacker.

## The idea for this story

This story talks about a sort of reverse evolution: how the _venomous_ version of Connido was purposely singled out, creating a situation in which only the _non-venomous_ ones survived. And so the animal species regressed.

This is inspired by what people cause in the real world. We often hunt venomous animals as a precaution. A snake that is "not that dangerous" is left alone. A snake known to be very venomous is dealt with.

And this can always go in two directions. Either the snakes develop an even _more_ potent poison (because that's the only way to survive now), or only the snakes _without poison_ are left. Well, humans have guns and snakes do not, so what we see in practice is that many snake species are losing their poison.

Besides that, the story is about intergenerational trauma: negative experiences passed on between parent and child. This _really happens_. Animal species who have lived around venomous or dangerous animals for a while, have a part of their brain dedicated to rapidly recognizing this animal and creating a response (which usually starts with fear). Even ... if they have never seen a snake in their life. Maybe that species hasn't seen a snake in many, many generations.

Think of cats who go _wild_ when they see a cucumber. _Something_ in their brain, from long ago, creates instant fear and response at this shape. Even if it makes no sense now. (Which makes it slightly immoral to test this "for fun and jokes", but oh well. It's like you're terrified of spiders and friends like to test your response by drawing spiders on your arm all the time.)

## Leftover Notes

This story was a challenge---and that was _on purpose_. I wanted to play with structure, in this case by making leaps forward in time. Because I wanted to be _correct_ (about the first species with poison and how that evolved by pure chance) and get a _tense story_. That's hard to do with something as intangible as "poison that exists because of tiny mistakes in proteins over millions of years".

In general, I try to write a few stories every cycle that are clearly different from the others. This will usually be around period 3--4 and period 7--8, but that's no certainty.

To decide if an animal is/was venomous, they usually look for three things:

* A place that _makes_ the poison
* A place to _deliver_ the poison ( = usually some pathway to your mouth)
* A way to create an _open wound_ in your victim ( = usually sharp teeth)

We obviously lack a living example of that 500 million year old Conodont. But by looking at the structure of teeth and skull, you can recognize patterns between all venomous animals.

General wisdoms:
* Venomous animals are usually primitive and barely change or evolve afterwards.
* Poison only works _after the fact_ as a defence. That's why many venomous animals also evolved to be brightly colored, to also indicate _beforehand_ that they should be left alone. (Otherwise you had to rely on a species having developed this "trauma" and knowing you were venomous and likely to kill _them_ too if they attacked.)
* Other animals then gained an advantage from imitating this and _pretending_ they were venomous, such as the milk snake (non-venomous) looking almost identical to the coral snake (venomous). Or the wasp and the hoverfly.
* _Venomous_ = if it eats you, you die.
* _Poisonous_ = if you eat it, you die.

### Cold-Blooded vs Warm-Blooded

* Cold-blooded animals (e.g. reptiles, snakes) _do_ actually change their temperature. The difference is that they don't do it _constantly_ from the inside. (Their body doesn't "work for it".)
* When they're cold, they just move to lay in the sun. When they're warm, they find a spot in the shade. Usually they apply an arsenal of tricks to regulate warmth anyway using their environment.
* Chemical processes happen faster when there's more heat. That's why a mammal (for example) can go from 0 to 100 in a very short time. But a cold-blooded animal needs more time to "warm up", and until that time they almost move in slow-motion or they can barely move.
