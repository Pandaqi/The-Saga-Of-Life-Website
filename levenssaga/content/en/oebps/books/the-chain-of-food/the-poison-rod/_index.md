A small fish receives to their surprise

A sour taste in the mouth that softens their lives

Suddenly they find wins against bigger fins

For one poisonous bite and they lost their life

&nbsp;

Many centuries after, they rose from the water

But the poison was lost, and so time runs short

As they search and search for how their poison disappeared

More and more of them die when meeting the Crocodiles they feared
