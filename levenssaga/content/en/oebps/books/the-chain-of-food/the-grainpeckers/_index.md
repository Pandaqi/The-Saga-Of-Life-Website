A clash with god-hating foes

In overgrown, new forests of rain

But what keeps enemies on their toes

Fills their bellies with nothing but pain

&nbsp;

One wants to grow many gardens of seeds

Another just searches for animal bait

They must quickly scour, they cannot wait

How to force nature to fulfill our needs?
