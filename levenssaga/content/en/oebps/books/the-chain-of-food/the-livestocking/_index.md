A farm called Nightingale

Locked its animals bad to worse

In smelly cages, dusty and stale

With tiny rooms and often a curse

&nbsp;

Kuku wants out and lets the secret slip

The farmer is eager to make her pay

Closed or open,

Young, old, large, or small

The animals plan to fight and move away
