Gods made first life

Tissue formed plants and creatures

But when they wanted to keep her

Instead they held a knife

&nbsp;

For the animals lived off the sun

And the oxygen in the sky

But their nutritional value was slight

And not enough to live on

&nbsp;

And so they searched for the healing chalice

Something to help the beasts remain

As Ardex explored a different claim

For he could not forget the Heavenly Palace
