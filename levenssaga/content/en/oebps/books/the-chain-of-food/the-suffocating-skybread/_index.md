Islands appear, white and bright

And everyone wants to have them

For while the number of animals on Somnia explodes

The amount of food is severely lacking

&nbsp;

If they don't capture enough islands

Most of Somnia would die of starvation

But the problems grow beyond one nation

As the largest war ever is here

Sustenance and safety quickly disappears

And the solution lies in the wrong scientist's hands
