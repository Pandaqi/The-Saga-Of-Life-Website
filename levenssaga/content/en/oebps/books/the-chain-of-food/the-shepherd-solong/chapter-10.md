Himnib deed not need his great sense of direction, or Solong's great eyes, to find Gallo. The Giant rose above everything, with a dense canopy that could have been the roof for an entire city. Nature around the tree seemed more full, more green, as if they had inhaled some of that original god magic. Their herds, now combined into _one_, ate from it with joy.

He could barely understand how a tree could be this old, large, strong, and beautiful at the same time. You could build an entire world here, a city of treehouses, and it would be heaven.

He sat down on a stone to give his broken leg some much needed rest. He healed quickly, which was no certainty at his age, but still not as quickly as he wanted. From his sitting position, he could enjoy the cool shade of Gallo, but also look out over the Saursea and the entrance to the Wolftunnels.

Behdo hopped towards him again. He'd done that for the entire journey. He kept offering his help in every situation and barely slept.

"I have explored the surroundings. There is no ba-danger. And I've already learned how we could _talk_ to Gallo. And---"

"Why do you do this, woolly friend?"

"Why do I do what?"

"Calm down. We'll survive without all that effort. Go and lay in the sun, next to Solong."

Behdo stood taut. "But, but, I don't want to leave!"

Himnib frowned. "Solong is just two tree lengths away, Behdo."

"I don't want to leave the herd!"

"Hmm? You saved the herd, Behdo. Why would you ever leave? Where is this coming from?"

"You said it yourself. There is only place for me if I am ba-useful."

Himnib laughed. "Is that it? Is that why you walked away and ran to the Council yourself? I thought the snow leopards had taken you or harmed you."

He shook his head and forget to give his broken leg a rest. "I can't say you are my best sheep, Behdo, because you are not. I can't let you bear children with all my female sheep, because then my entire herd would be as small and sick as you in ten years. I am sorry, it's an unfortunate situation for you. But there is _no reason_ to be scared that I kick you out."

He embraced Behdo, crouching in the grass. "You are a living being. Just by existing, you've won a battle every day. Just by being the next sheep in line, you form protection for the others. You don't need to make yourself useful every second of every day---you are fine the way you are."

Behdo felt stronger than ever, while losing control over his entire body. He wanted to roll through the grass, enjoy the sun, and scream at everyone that he _lived_ and was _one of Himnib's sheep!_

"Speaking of that," Himnib mumbled. He walked away, leaning on his cane that he really _needed_ now.

Hidden by Gallo's thick trunk, a female sheep lay on the floor. Solong leaned over her body with a worried expression.

"She ... she ..."

The female bleated loudly. Solong placed her paws around her belly, as carefully as she could.

Slowly, a red, small, living being slid out of it. 

Himnib landed next to Solong and helped calm down the sheep, as he kept a watchful eye on her heartbeat and breathing. BehdiÃ«l stood behind him, alternating between being a very proud or a very worried dad.

Before Behdo could blink, Solong held a small lamb in her arms. 

Everyone held their breath. No bleating, no singing bird, no howls from Sheepdogs who sat on their hunches like statues. These were the crucial hours. Himnib brought the lamb blankets to make it feel warm and safe, while Solong cared for the mother.

Until deep in the night, those two refused to leave the newborn's side. Himnib checked time and time again if the lamb still lived, breathed, wasn't sick, had no deformities. When both he and Solong finally fell asleep, exhausted, the lamb stood up herself.

She waggled, moving by falling and getting up again, to her mother's udders.

Behdo assumed guard and protectively lay down next to them. The baby was strong. She'd survive. She was a new living being, that wasn't part of the world yesterday, but could walk, think, run, play, and strengthen the herd.

She was enough to take away Behdo's last doubts.

Just by existing, she was enough.

They'd visit Compana next. Looking for the lost shepherds and how Himnib's cane received its magic. Among the animals of Somnia, a resentment against the Companions and their methods grew, but they were always friendly with the shepherds. Then they told about a land called Magica, at the tip of Compana, its very lowest point. Every story about magic that Himnib had heard, could be traced back to this place.

But first they'd meet the lion king Tibbowe, further down in Traferia. It was on their path anyway. His palace roof was leaking---and once a Bearchitect, always a Bearchitect.

_And so it was that life continued ..._
