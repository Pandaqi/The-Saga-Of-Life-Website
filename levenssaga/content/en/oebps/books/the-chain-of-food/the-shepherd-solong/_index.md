Their homeland destroyed

The bears become traveling shepherds

But their lifestyle turns void

If all borders close, forever

&nbsp;

Hated because they ravage an entire field

Then leave to do it again somewhere else

Companions secretly work to invent strict laws

To force the Shepherds to forever yield
