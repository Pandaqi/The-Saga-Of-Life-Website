Magim placed the bearded dragons in a row. Their faces pointed towards the incoming Fleshfeasters, the Nightriver at their back. They'd rather not. They'd rather turn around and flee, but for now they followed Magim's commands.

The foremost Fleshfeaster, almost as huge as their Leader, lunged at the slowest animals.

Higgis collected several stones in his mouth and looked at his friend Magim.

"Attack!" Magim yelled.

Higgis threw the stones. The bearded dragons blew their beards to full size, like a balloon that could fill itself in less than a heartbeat, and made sure their balance was steady. Some still turned around and raced to the Nightriver.

Because Higgis had purposely thrown the stones at _them_.

The bumped into beards, creating huge dents, causing the bearded dragons to roar and blow up even more, until the stones bounced _off_ of the beards as if they were the strongest trampolines in the world.

They flew at the Fleshfeasters with terrifying speed. Or, well, half of them did. Higgis' eyesight had caused the other half of the stones to land in trees and the Nightriver.

They flew faster than Magim could follow. He could not see the stones themselves---the gigantic Fleshfeasters falling to the ground, roaring, were hard to miss.

Magim noticed another feeling that had never been this strong before. Relief? Victory? The same positive energy poured into the other bearded dragons. 

"It works! Continue!"

They stood up just a little more straight, with just a little better balance, as they met the next rain of stones by Higgis with less fear. A rain of stones that, after an elastic bounce, rained down on their attackers. Most did not fall down due to a tiny stone, but they now limped, or had lost one eye. They learned to avoid the stones, even if they flew faster than Cosmo himself.

Overjoyed by their success, they did not notice the Fleshfeasters encircled them.

By the time they fired the fifth stone salvo, a row of shiny triangular teeth separated them from the rest of the group.

"Fall back!"

Step one: new plan. Step two: who was left? Left and right, animals were snatched away, like how Magim snatched insects from the air without a second thought. Higgis stood beside him. The strongest bearded dragons, who had developed spikes and stronger paws, stood beside him. 

Step three: do as he always did. Copy and imitate.

He gestured to the remaining animals to climb on top of Higgis. They hesitated again, their eyes distrustful. Magim had to give the right example first and climbed to the most dangerous place: Higgis' snout. He was uncertain himself---but they were running out of time.

The others climbed Higgis too, turning him into a tree with forty branches pointing in all directions. A low, thick tree. And all branches had their own eyes, paws and tails. But under Magim's loud commands, they could turn that shape into something that ... vaguely resembled a Fleshfeaster.

When Higgis made himself tall and opened his mouth, ten animals _played_ his gigantic teeth. 

The other Fleshfeasters froze and looked at it oddly. Magim and the animals imitated that expression too, just like their posture. The closer their enemies got, the more dumbfounded they were.

"What you do?" Even such a short sentence from a Fleshfeaster echoed terrifyingly across the valley.

"I biggest Fleshfeaster of all! I eat you!" 

_Higgis is going too far,_ Magim thought. _But it's working._

More than half the Fleshfeasters turned around and trudged away. To some other piece of land where they could eat animals in peace.

Or so Magim thought.

Then they said: "Getting Leader. _He_ biggest Fleshfeaster of all---will eat _you_!"

Of course Magim had just made it worse. And he had devised such a good plan! There was no time to say sorry. After this comment, the imitation fell apart, throwing all the animals around eggs as if they had burst from the same egg. 

They ran to the Nightriver. The animals had finally managed to knock down a tree. It rolled left and right, almost tumbling into the black, churning waves.

A few bearded dragons finally used their wits. They grabbed stones and placed them around the tree trunk, stopping it from rolling away. Satisfied, they were the first to use the tree as a bridge and safely run to the other side. 

Magim reached the shore, ready to cross himself, when he noticed his reflection in the water.

He only _recognized_ himself after more animals had passed him by. For in his mouth, which had felt wrong and dry for so long, grew one white, sharp, triangular teeth.

_I'm ... I'm becoming a Fleshfeaster too,_ he thought. _No, I am one already._

He wasn't sure if he should still cross. One tooth would not make a difference against the monsters behind him. But if he crossed, nothing would be solved. All animals still had to flee, but for _him_.

Frightened eyes looked up and saw a group of Forefrogs hobble over the tree. Five left---four arrived.

From the water jumped a black silhouette, unrecognizable through the waterfalls around them. It snatched one frog with terrifying precision. Some frogs immediately fell flat on the tree to play dead; others now tried to reach the other side with one mighty leap.

They all lost to the mass of Fleshfeasters jumping out of the water. Gigantich squids, mixtures between fishes and lizards, crabs with claws sharper than spikes. The water came alive and they were born from it. The black water that had hidden all those meat eaters and secretly allowed them to grow.

The bearded dragons attacked with more stones, now aiming at the water. But the slippery sea creatures were harder to see or hit. A second bridge was placed, far from the first, and all animals aggressively pushed each other around for the privilege to use it immediately.

Magim stood next to the river, with Haggis, watching as their group shrank. Half reached the other side safely, half did not reach anything anymore.

What to do? What's the next step? 

Plant eaters had been in the minority for a while, he realized now. Meat eaters already ruled this world.

Higgis pressed his paw against Magim's new triangular tooth. "That how started with my grandfather," he mumbled. "You run to survive. But your grandgrandchildren have more teeth and be true Fleshfeasters."

"If we work together, we improve our chances."

A few Fleshfeasters suddenly turned around and started walking on land. Their fish-like bodies could only wiggle out of water for a few moments, but it was enough to snatch most unsuspecting animals.

Now they were truly encircled by meat eaters on all sides.

Their Leader had been called upon and reached the Nightriver, howling and barking at the moon.

But loud footsteps also sounded on the _other_ side.

Those who had safely crossed the river now fled in different directions. What was once a semblance of group now only held animals that prioritized their own survival and nothing else. Rightly so, Magim thought. Still stupid.

But their new visitors were no Fleshfeasters, but gods. Angry gods.

"Stop! Now! Your goddess demands it!"

Feria lept through the air as if her beautiful pink fox fur also contained wings. She landed precisely on top of the second tree trunk bridge. Most Fleshfeasters knew what was coming and slithered back into their hiding places, as if the water had turned to quicksand that swalloed them. Some attacked her, which only gained them sudden illness or heart troubles.

_This is not a Feria asking questions,_ Magim thought. _This is a goddess giving demands. Please, please give the right demands._

"We demand the Leader of the Fleshfeasters reveal themselves to us for punishment. Or we will exterminate _all_ Fleshfeasters!"

Her stern expression, however, fell away when she saw that Leader. Was even _she_ afraid of him? 

No, no, that wasn't it. It was a growing disbelief. As if she realized something but _refused_ to believe that.

The Leader stepped forward, into the light from sudden fires that broke out around the Nightriver. Its shimmering almost created the impression that it was a normal river with normal water. The light confirmed Feria's suspicions---and she dropped her shoulders low.

Her own _pet_, the sweet Hespryhound, was the Leader. The First Fleshfeaster, the one who had changed the others with his touch.

"What ... what ... why?"

"I can't help it. I am a meat eter, Feria, that's how you designed me."

"No. No no no. When I made you, there were no living creatures yet, surely no Fleshfeasters!" She lectured as if she spoke to her little kid. A kid who said something she didn't _want_ to hear, knowing it to be true.

"You made me based off Father's stories, to make him happy. Stories about strong monsters, enormous giants, heroic life. And now ..." The Hespryhound looked around. His gigantic tail hung between his legs and his soft ears fell flat over his cheeks. "When I was released from the Heavenly Palace, I wanted to run around, play, life on this pretty world. But all life I touched ... became a meat eater."

"No. It's not true. You ... you ..." Feria punched her Hespryhound, then hugged him again. "I can't punish---go, disappear, flee before Ardex---"

The other gods also stormed the place: Ardex, Darus and Eeris. Cosmo flew in the distance.

Slowly, the Fleshfeasters came out of the water again. All held their breath, waiting for the judgment of the gods. Who was allowed to live? Who would be exterminated?

Why did the gods have that power in the first place?

They discussed. Feria kept looking over her shoulder, to her Hespryhound who looked remorseful. Ardex made a proposal. Feria hit him in the face and stopped listening.

"Nobody touches _my Hespry_ with their foul---"

"One _dog_, against thousands of animals who most fear for their life every moment now!"

"Says the god who has been _killing_ meat eaters for years just because they accidentally existed!"

They whispered again. No animal dared move, make a sound, even breathe. What was the decision?

"They feel pain, just like us," Eeris' loud voice broke through that silence. "They feel fear, just like us."

"But they _are not like us_!" Feria shrieked.

"Then only one conclusion remains," Cosmo said, as he landed in a whirlwind. His supreme hearing had helped him follow the discussion, even from the other side of the world---or that's how it sometimes seemed. "We do nothing."

"You sound like Hanah."

"Time and time we see that she was right."

"Interference by the gods has only worked against us so far," Darus spoke sadly.

"Where is Gulvi?" Ardex growled. "He should've seen these beasts underwater for centuries! But he probably didn't speak up because he _listened to Hanah_. Now see what came of it!"

"What came of it," said a high squeaking voice from the Nightriver, "is a strong ocean."

A bright blue light appeared under water. Moments later, a dolphin jumped out of the water, floating in the air through a mist of water droplets. "Life on land has been static. Centuries went by and we only have a few different land dwellers! Barely able to run or defend themselves! But in my waters ..."

The other gods seemed surprised by Gulvi's appearance. Last time Magim saw him, he'd been a much smaller dolphin. And his sweet squeaky voice didn't match his serious words anymore.

"So only one conclusion remains." Cosmo studied the others seriously. 

_He should have only concerned himself with the sky, dear reader, but birds didn't exist yet and the first insects didn't fly high enough. So he concerned himself with everything._

The gods nodded towards each other. An understanding passed between them, unspoken and invisible to other animals, but strengthened by their magical bond.

Feria faced all frozen creatures. She swallowed and faced the ground, as if she'd find a better solution there.

"From this day forwards," she said formally, "all meat eters will officially be accepted as just one more animal species on Somnia. The gods will not chase them or interfere. Meat eaters will now be called Carnivores, plant eaters Herbivores. Most of you have eaten insects for a while, and we will name you Insectivores."

The predators looked around, grinning, licking their teeth. Claws were ready to snatch their neighbors. The others stepped backward. Magim heard a thousand curses for the gods, and however this night ended, they should never expect support from the herbivores ever again.

Eeris quickly walked forward and curled her neck around a shaking Feria, who cuddled her Hespryhound. Afraid that, if she let him go, they would all still attack her pet for what he'd accidentally caused.

"But all herbivores are free to flee with me," Eeris said just as formally. "To the Rainbow Forest, where I have provided enough food for all. And I want a day's head start."

All crowded around the giraffe's legs. Eeris was barely visible between the herbivores when they left. The gods had to create several walls of wind, fire and water to hold the disappointed and hungry Fleshfeasters in place.

Magim went with Eeris---when he looked back, Higgis still stood on the other side and walked away.
