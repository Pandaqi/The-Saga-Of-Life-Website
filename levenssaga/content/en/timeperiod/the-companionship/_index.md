The First Conflict ends, definitively, with the Companions striking an accord. Each species may send one of them to the Council of Nion, to work together and decide about the future together. There's peace. There's space for belief, progress, experimentation. But without help from the gods, and a new continent suddenly rising from the sea, it's hard to keep this peace.

This period is also called _Friendly Peace_ or _Brothers of Nature_.
