This last time period leads us into space. Most life on Somnia has stepped into spacecraft in search of other, habitable planets. Humankind colonizes the galaxy, with unexpected obstacles and meetings. They search the boundary of the universe, the edge of their own capability, and come closer and closer. But will they ever reach it?

This time period is also called _Stargazing_, _Lighthunters_ or _The Space Rejourney_.
