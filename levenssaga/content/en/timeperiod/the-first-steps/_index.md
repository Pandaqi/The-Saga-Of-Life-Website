This beautiful time period starts with the first animals to leave the ocean and walk onto the land. The world is blooming. Somnia is full of growth, discovery, green and sun. The first plants and animals claim their spot in the world.

This period is also called _Startlings_, _Seedsearch_ or _Discovery of the Soul_.
