The world is getting (over)crowded. Different groups fight each other for land, resources, power, or revenge for the actions of the gods. This period is based on wars fought in ancient times and can only end one way: one of the groups is destroyed.

This period is also called _Fire of Fragility_, _Birth of Magic_ or _Godset_.
