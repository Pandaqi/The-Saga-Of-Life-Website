This time period is our current, modern day. The biggest wars, changes and (r)evolutions seem behind us. There is peace---but it's still fragile. The biggest danger is not survival, which allows creatures to try and _live_ ... besides the humans putting their fingers into every pie. Until the planet becomes uninhabitable and everybody flees into space.

This period is also called _Defeated Peace_, _Landstill_, or _Humanmight_.
