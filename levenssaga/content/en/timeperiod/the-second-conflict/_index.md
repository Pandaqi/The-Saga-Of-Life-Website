A worldwide war ensues which makes the First Conflict look like child's play. Because now the world is fully claimed and many animals possess better weapons and technology. Half of them want revenge for everything and against everyone, while the other half searches creative ways to stop the wars. Without gods or peaceful Companions to help---but with more and more powerful magic---only one can win such a war: the human that rises. (This period is based on the First and Second World War.)

This period is also called _The Incredible Insurrection_ or _The Danger of Thousand Suns_.
