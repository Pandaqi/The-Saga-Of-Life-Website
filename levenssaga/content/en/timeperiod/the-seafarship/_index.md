The travels from the previous period taught all creatures how to sail the seas. This leads to the discovery of a whole new part of the world and many islands. The Seafarers bring everyone together again, like the Companions of old, but also ensure there's space for everyone. A peace that turns sour quickly when one of these benevolent beings is killed.

This period is also called _The Fearfloods_, _Quest to the West_, or _Inhabislands_.
