This first time period chronicles the times before the creation of Somnia. It tells of how the demigods were born, how they aided their Father with tasks across the galaxy, right until the moment they were suddenly banished from the heavenly palace.

This period is also called _Dark Days_, _Chaos Chronicles_ or _StArdext_.
