At the heart of the world---literally---a new continent rises from the sea. Everyone races towards Floria to claim it for themselves. The peace and prosperity of the previous period is quickly replaced with loneliness and individualism. A next Conflict is brewing. But travels also show a bright side, such as the discovery of new animals and seeds, which finally leads to _grass_.

This period is also called _Healing Heart_, _Waterwinners_, _The Centerconflict_, or _Discovery of Floria_.
