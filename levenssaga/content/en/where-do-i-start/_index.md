Welcome to the Saga of Life! Great to hear you're ready to jump into this fantastical, sprawling saga. Of course, it _does_ feel a little overwhelming, doesn't it? Breaking a story into many short stories---a so-called "frame story"---makes them more approachable and accessible, but also means there's no clear beginning or end.

This page will help you get started.

## For the brave: start anywhere

In theory, you can start **anywhere**. All stories are standalone. If information from other stories is truly necessary, it's explained again within the text. I obviously try to make each story equally fun, valuable, and interesting.

## For the practical: prequels

In practice, though, most people do not like entering a story that clearly has background which they do not know. Or perhaps they're afraid they can't fully appreciate a story without knowing what came before. 

Some stories _are_ more connected than others. To help you out with those, I list the **prequels** at the information section of that book. It usually contains one or two stories that I think are most helpful to read before this one. Generally, this will be in chronological order anyway. (Stories from cycle 1 become relevant in cycle 2, not the other way around.)

## For the newcomers: Starter stories

But even then, you need some place to _start_. You need a first story. An entrance into the Saga of Life.

For this, I created the [Starter](/en/genre/starter) category.

It contains any stories that I deem a good "starter". I aim to write one such story per cycle. 

Those stories will rely on (almost) no previous knowledge or stories. They will be about something crucial and intrinsic to the Saga of Life, which means it automatically introduces you to the world and what you can expect. They will be true starters, whose events lead into many other stories.

In conclusion, **unsure where to start? Pick a Starter story!**
