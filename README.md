# The Saga of Life (Website)

This is the full source code / project behind [The Saga of Life](https://thesagaoflife.com), my experiment into online, interactive, large-scale storytelling.

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while. It also contains a second theme that I can use to generate an _epub_ of any portion of the website instead.

The actual website (hosted online) is inside `levenssaga`. Everything else is metadata or documents to support the website.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. In fact, as expected, you can find upcoming (perhaps unfinished) stories if you know where to look.

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do. 

(The "website" portion of this repository obviously betrays that there's another private repository with the actual future plans and documents for the Saga of Life. I initially wanted to release that as well, but most people assured me they wouldn't be able to refrain themselves from looking at spoilers and already checking how the saga would end. So that one stays private!)

This project is currently Dutch first, English second. That will probably change sometime in the future, once all my translations have caught up.
